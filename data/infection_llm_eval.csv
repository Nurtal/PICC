26045668,Catheter care delay,Yes,"catheter care delay (or =2.612, 95% ci: 1.373-4.969) and indwelling mostly in summer (or =4.784, 95% ci: 2.681-8.538) were associated with higher infection incidence. conclusion: statlock fixing and tip position located in the lower one-third of the superior vena cava were protective factors against picc-related infection, while catheter care delay and indwelling mostly in summer were risk factors.."
33298237,Parenteral nutrition,Yes,"parenteral nutrition (odds ratio [or], 3.40; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.77-6.52) and admission to the hematology ward (or, 4.90; 95% ci, 2.25-10.71) were independently associated with crbsi and pb, respectively.."
25198813,Power-injectable piccs,Yes,one hundred and eighty adult patients candidate to chemotherapy were randomized into three groups: power-injectable piccs with solo-2 proximal valve (bard); power-injectable piccs with pasv (pressure activated safety valve) proximal valve (navilyst); and non-valved power-injectable piccs (medcomp)..
34218708,Parenteral nutrition,Yes,"more than 1â€‰million peripherally inserted central catheters (picc) are placed annually in the us and are used to provide convenient vascular access for a variety of reasons including long term antibiotic treatment, chemotherapy, parenteral nutrition, and blood draws.."
33409725,Chemotherapy,No,"eleven hindrances were summarized, including high costs, unavailability of local services, worries about affecting family members, a lack of health awareness, inconvenient transportations, fluke minds, physical discomfort, fears of leukemia and chemotherapy, short chemotherapy intervals, damage to appearance, and no insurance coverage of costs.."
24090605,Acute myeloid leukemia,No,infections increase the risk of central venous catheter-related thrombosis in adult acute myeloid leukemia..
26202391,Auto/allograft,Yes,"multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a higher picc-related infection rate with chemotherapy (odds ratio (or) 7.2-confidence interval (ci) 95% [1.77-29.5]), auto/allograft (or 5.9-ci 95% [1.2-29.2]), and anti-coagulant therapy (or 2.2-95% [1.4-12]). conclusion: chemotherapy, auto/allograft, and anti-coagulant therapy are associated with an increased risk of developing picc-related infections. clinical advance: chemotherapy, auto/allograft, and anti-coagulant therapy are important predictors of picc-associated infections.."
36597793,Previous PICC,Yes,"in the multivariate analysis, previous picc placement within 6 months was an independent risk factor for a picc-associated bloodstream infection (odds ratio, 2.835; 95% confidence interval, 1.143-7.034; p=0.025).."
27020965,Chemotherapy,Yes,"background and objectives: the increasing use of peripherally inserted central venous catheters (piccs) for chemotherapy has led to the observation of an elevated risk of complications and failures. statistically significant risk factors were previous dvt (hr 2.95, 95%ci 1.33-6.53), reason for picc implant (hr 3.65, 95%ci 1.12-10.34) and 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab based chemotherapy (hr 3.11, 95%ci 1.17-8.26). nevertheless, a 15% rate of failure has to be taken in account when planning picc insertion for chemotherapy purposes.."
34628865,Chemotherapy,Yes,"risk factors for peripherally inserted central catheter (picc)-associated infections in patients receiving chemotherapy and the preventive effect of a self-efficacy intervention program: a randomized controlled trial. in this study, we retrospectively analyzed picc-associated infections in chemotherapy patients treated at our hospital in recent years to identify risk factors for picc-associated infections and the preventive effect of a self-efficacy intervention program. methods: using a convenience sampling method, we selected 159 cancer patients who received chemotherapy through a picc at our hospital between july 2017 and december 2018, and the patients were randomly divided to an observation group (n=79) and a control group (n=80) using a random number table. results: among the 159 chemotherapy patients, 26 (16.35%) experienced picc-associated infections in this finished trial.."
