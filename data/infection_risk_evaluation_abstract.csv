25374804,Medical department admission (including ICU),"focus on peripherally inserted central catheters in critically ill patients. . venous access devices are of pivotal importance for an increasing number of critically ill patients in a variety of disease states and in a variety of clinical settings (emergency, intensive care, surgery) and for different purposes (fluids or drugs infusions, parenteral nutrition, antibiotic therapy, hemodynamic monitoring, procedures of dialysis/apheresis). however, healthcare professionals are commonly worried about the possible consequences that may result using a central venous access device (cvad) (mainly, bloodstream infections and thrombosis), both peripherally inserted central catheters (piccs) and centrally inserted central catheters (ciccs). this review aims to discuss indications, insertion techniques, and care of piccs in critically ill patients. piccs have many advantages over standard ciccs. first of all, their insertion is easy and safe -due to their placement into peripheral veins of the arm- and the advantage of a central location of catheter tip suitable for all osmolarity and ph solutions. using the ultrasound-guidance for the picc insertion, the risk of hemothorax and pneumothorax can be avoided, as well as the possibility of primary malposition is very low. picc placement is also appropriate to avoid post-procedural hemorrhage in patients with an abnormal coagulative state who need a cvad. some limits previously ascribed to piccs (i.e., low flow rates, difficult central venous pressure monitoring, lack of safety for radio-diagnostic procedures, single-lumen) have delayed their start up in the intensive care units as common practice. though, the recent development of power-injectable piccs overcomes these technical limitations and piccs have started to spread in critical care settings. two important take-home messages may be drawn from this review. first, the incidence of complications varies depending on venous accesses and healthcare professionals should be aware of the different clinical performance as well as of the different risks associated with each type of cvad (ciccs or piccs). second, an inappropriate cvad choice and, particularly, an inadequate insertion technique are relevant-and often not recognized-potential risk factors for complications in critically ill patients. we strongly believe that all healthcare professionals involved in the choice, insertion or management of cvads in critically ill patients should know all potential risk factors of complications. this knowledge may minimize complications and guarantee longevity to the cvad optimizing the risk/benefit ratio of cvad insertion and use. proper management of cvads in critical care saves lines and lives. much evidence from the medical literature and from the clinical practice supports our belief that, compared to ciccs, the so-called power-injectable peripherally inserted central catheters are a good alternative choice in critical care.

24090605,Acute myeloid leukemia,"infections increase the risk of central venous catheter-related thrombosis in adult acute myeloid leukemia. . introduction: central venous catheters (cvc) related thrombosis (crt) represents a well known complication in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (aml) receiving intensive chemotherapy but the efficacy of antithrombotic prophylaxis still remains controversial. patients and methods: we analyzed 71 consecutive aml patients whose cvc was inserted before each chemotherapy cycle for an overall number of 106 cvc placements. in 47/106 insertions, a prophylaxis with 100 iu/kg/day low molecular weight heparin (lmwh) was administered for 7 days after cvc insertion and additional 7 after cvc removal. this unconventional dose of lmwh, although higher than usual, appeared adequate for a short-course approach. lmwh was delivered regardless of the platelet (plt) count once provided that it should have been maintained above 20 x 10(9)/l by transfusions. results: of 106 insertions, we observed 19 (18%) episodes of crt, 58 (54%) of sepsis and 50 (47%) infections of cvc-exit site with no difference between lmwh and no-lmwh group. occurrence of crt was significantly associated with cvc-exit site infections (14/19, p=0.01) and sepsis (16/19, p=0.005) with no difference between lmwh and no-lmwh group. in multivariate analysis, both cvc-exit site infections and sepsis were confirmed to be independent risk factors for crt development. conclusion: our retrospective study, although based on a small sample size, suggests that the occurrence of cvc-exit site infections and neutropenic sepsis following chemotherapy significantly increases the risk of crt in aml, independently from the use of lmwh prophylaxis.

29595367,Antibiotic therapy,"lessons learned from the implementation of a medically enhanced residential treatment (mert) model integrating intravenous antibiotics and residential addiction treatment. . background: hospitalizations for severe infections associated with substance use disorder (sud) are increasing. people with sud often remain hospitalized for many weeks instead of completing intravenous antibiotics at home; often, they are denied skilled nursing facility admission. residential sud treatment facilities are not equipped to administer intravenous antibiotics. we developed a medically enhanced residential treatment (mert) model integrating residential sud treatment and long-term iv antibiotics as part of a broader hospital-based addiction medicine service. mert had low recruitment and retention, and ended after six months. the goal of this study was to describe the feasibility and acceptability of mert, to understand implementation factors, and explore lessons learned. methods: we conducted a mixed-methods evaluation. we included all potentially eligible mert patients, defined by those needing ≥2 weeks of intravenous antibiotics discharged from february 1 to august 1, 2016. we used chart review to identify diagnoses, antibiotic treatment location, and number of recommended and actual iv antibiotic-days completed. we audio-recorded and transcribed key informant interviews with patients and staff. we conducted an ethnographic analysis of interview transcripts and implementation field notes. results: of the 45 patients needing long-term intravenous antibiotics, 18 were ineligible and 20 declined mert. 7 enrolled in mert and three completed their recommended intravenous antibiotic course. mert recruitment barriers included patient ambivalence towards residential treatment, wanting to prioritize physical health needs, and fears of untreated pain in residential. mert retention barriers included high demands of residential treatment, restrictive practices due to picc lines, and perceptions by staff and other residents that mert patients ""stood out"" as ""different."" despite the challenges, key informants felt mert was a positive construct. conclusions: though mert had many possible advantages; it proved more challenging to implement than anticipated. our lessons may be applicable to future models integrating post-hospital intravenous antibiotics and sud care.

31674857,Chemotherapy,"picc-port totally implantable vascular access device in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. . background and objectives: the increasing use of arm totally implantable vascular access devices for breast cancer patients who require chemotherapy has led to a greater risk of complications and failures and, in particular, to upper extremity deep vein thrombosis. this study aims to investigate the outcomes of the arm peripherally inserted central catheter-port technique in breast cancer patients. methods: the peripherally inserted central catheter-port technique is an evolution of the standard arm-totally implantable vascular access device implant based on guided ultrasound venous access in the proximal third of the upper limb with subsequent placement of the reservoir at the middle third of the arm. a prospective study was conducted on 418 adult female breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. the primary study outcome was peripherally inserted central catheter-port failure. results: median follow-up was 215 days. complications occurred in 29 patients (6.9%) and failure resulting in removal of the device in 11 patients (2.6%). the main complication we observed was upper extremity deep vein thrombosis, 10 (2.4%); all patients were rescued by anticoagulant treatment without peripherally inserted central catheter-port removal. the main reason for removal was reservoir pocket infection: 4 (0.9%) with an infection rate of 0.012 per 1000 catheter days. cumulative 1-year risk of failure was 3.6% (95% confidence interval, 1.3%-7.1%). with regard to the patients' characteristics, body mass index <22.5 was the only significant risk for failure (p = 0.027). conclusion: the peripherally inserted central catheter-port is a safe vascular device for chemotherapy delivery that achieves similar clinical results as traditional long-term vascular access devices (peripherally inserted central catheter and arm totally implantable vascular access device, in particular) in breast cancer patients.
