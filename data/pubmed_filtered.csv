24440542,2014,"PICC-associated bloodstream infections: prevalence, patterns, and predictors. ","BACKGROUND: Growing use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) has led to recognition of the risk of PICC-associated bloodstream infection. We sought to identify rates, patterns, and patient, provider, and device characteristics associated with this adverse outcome. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of consecutive adults who underwent PICC placement from June 2009 to July 2012 was assembled. Using multivariable logistic and Cox-proportional hazards regression models, covariates specified a priori were analyzed for their association with PICC-associated bloodstream infection. Odds ratios (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to express the association between each predictor and the outcome of interest. RESULTS: During the study period, 966 PICCs were inserted in 747 unique patients for a total of 26,887 catheter days. Indications for PICC insertion included: long-term antibiotic administration (52%, n = 503), venous access (21%, n = 201), total parenteral nutrition (16%, n = 155), and chemotherapy (11%, n = 107). On bivariate analysis, intensive care unit (ICU) status (OR 3.23; 95% CI, 1.84-5.65), mechanical ventilation (OR 4.39; 95% CI, 2.46-7.82), length of stay (hospital, OR 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.06 and ICU, OR 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.04), PowerPICCs (C. R. Bard, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ; OR 2.58; 95% CI, 1.41-4.73), and devices placed by interventional radiology (OR 2.57; 95% CI, 1.41-4.68) were associated with PICC-bloodstream infection. Catheter lumens were strongly associated with this event (double lumen, OR 5.21; 95% CI, 2.46-11.04, and triple lumen, OR 10.84; 95% CI, 4.38-26.82). On multivariable analysis, only hospital length of stay, ICU status, and number of PICC lumens remained significantly associated with PICC bloodstream infection. Notably, the HR for PICC lumens increased substantially, suggesting earlier time to infection among patients with multi-lumen PICCs (HR 4.08; 95% CI, 1.51-11.02 and HR 8.52; 95% CI, 2.55-28.49 for double- and triple-lumen devices, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: PICC-associated bloodstream infection is most associated with hospital length of stay, ICU status, and number of device lumens. Policy and procedural oversights targeting these factors may be necessary to reduce the risk of this adverse outcome.

34600737,2022,PICC versus midlines: Comparison of peripherally inserted central catheters and midline catheters with respect to incidence of thromboembolic and infectious complications. ,"INTRODUCTION: To decrease the complications related to central catheters there has been an increasing utilization of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) and ultrasound-guided long peripheral intravenous catheters (i.e. midlines). While the complications of PICC lines are well described there is less reported data on complications related to midline catheters. Our study aims are to compare the incidences of infectious and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and sepsis related to PICCs and Midlines. METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective review at an academic hospital. Data were collected on patients admitted between 1/1/2014-5/31/2016. Patient demographics, hospital length of stay (LOS), and ventilator days were collected. Outcomes of interest were line-related infections and thromboembolic events after the placement of these catheters. Endpoints were compared between three groups (PICC group, midline group and PICC placement followed by midline placement group). Univariate and multivariable analyses were used to compare across the three groups. RESULTS: The study included 3560 unique patients with 5058 catheters. There was an increase in use of midlines over the observed study period (245% increase from the end of 2015 to the middle of 2016). We found no significant differences in the rates of DVT among the three groups (PICC 4%, midline 3% and PICC-midline 4%; p = 0.12). There were no differences across the groups for sepsis (PICC 29%, midline 27%, and PICC-midline 32%; p = 0.14) or septic shock (PICC 7%, midline 8%, and PICC-midline 6%; p = 0.39). Adjusted means LOS were higher for patients with PICC lines compared to midlines, in both females and males. PICC group stayed longer, on average, on the ventilator compared to the midline group. No other significant differences were seen among groups. CONCLUSION: Increased utilization of midline catheters were not associated with decreased risk of DVT or sepsis when compared to peripherally inserted central catheters.

34218708,2023,PICC line management among patients with chronic kidney disease. ,"More than 1 million peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) are placed annually in the US and are used to provide convenient vascular access for a variety of reasons including long term antibiotic treatment, chemotherapy, parenteral nutrition, and blood draws. Although they are relatively easy to place and inexpensive, PICC line use is associated with many complications such as phlebitis/thrombophlebitis, venous thrombosis, catheter-related infection, wound infection, and central vein stenosis. These complications are far more deleterious for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) whose lives depend on a functioning hemodialysis access once they reach end stage kidney disease (ESKD). Despite recent guidelines to avoid PICC lines in CKD and ESKD patients, clinical use remains high. There is an ongoing urgency to educate and inform health care providers and the CKD patients themselves in preserving their venous real estate. In this article, we review AV access and PICC line background, complications associated with PICC lines in the CKD population, and recommendations for alternatives to placing a PICC line in this vulnerable patient population.

23472835,2013,Advantages and disadvantages of peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICC) compared to other central venous lines: a systematic review of the literature. ,"BACKGROUND: The use of central venous lines carries a significant risk for serious complications and high economic costs. Lately, the peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) has gained in popularity due to presumed advantages over other central venous lines. The aim of this systematic literature review was to identify scientific evidence justifying the use of PICC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The literature review was performed according to the principles of Cochrane Collaboration. The electronic literature search included common databases up to March 2011. Only those studies rated as high or moderate quality were used for grading of evidence and conclusions. RESULTS: The search resulted in 827 abstracts, 48 articles were read in full text, and 11 met the inclusion criteria. None of the articles was classified as high quality and two had moderate quality. The results of these two studies indicate that PICC increases the risk for deep venous thrombosis (DVT), but decreases the risk for catheter occlusion. The quality of scientific evidence behind these conclusions, however, was limited. Due to the lack of studies with sufficiently high quality, questions such as early complications, patient satisfaction and costs could not be answered. DISCUSSION: We conclude that although PICCs are frequently used in oncology, scientific evidence supporting any advantage or disadvantage of PICC when comparing PICC with traditional central venous lines is limited, apart from a tendency towards increased risk for DVT and a decreased risk for catheter occlusion with PICC.

37314592,2023,Clinical factors of PICC-RVT in cancer patients: a meta-analysis. ,"PURPOSE: There is a lack of studies that systematically evaluate the clinical factors of PICC-RVT such as treatment, tumor stage, metastasis, and chemotherapy drugs in cancer patients. This study, therefore, aims to evaluate the clinical factors of catheter-related venous thrombosis in cancer patients with indwelling PICC to provide a basis for the clinical prevention and reduction of thrombosis. METHODS: Relevant studies were retrieved from major databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WanFang Data, and China Biology Medicine disc (CMB)) and searched from their earliest available dates until July 2022. If two or more studies had the same outcome, a meta-analysis using RevMan 5.4.1 was performed. This systematic review was registered at PROSPERO (number CRD42022358426). RESULTS: A total of 19 articles involving 19,824 patients were included for quantitative analysis. Meta-analysis of these studies indicated that a history of chemotherapy, tumor type, tumor stage, presence or absence of metastasis, and use of fluorouracil, etoposide, platinum drugs, and taxane were all risk factors for PICC catheter thrombosis in cancer patients. CONCLUSION: In clinical PICC catheter thrombosis prevention, patients with the above characteristics should be watched more closely than other patients, as they have a higher risk for PICC catheter thrombosis. Based on the present evidence at hand, radiotherapy cannot be considered to be related to the formation of PICC-RVT in cancer patients.

31406874,2019,Peripherally inserted central catheters in critically ill patients - complications and its prevention: A review. ,"Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) is extensively used in critical care settings, because it plays a vital role in providing safe central venous entry. However, PICC is associated with several complications, which should be detected to shorten the duration of patients' improvement, reduce health care cost, and lessen the incidence of various PICC-related complications. Therefore, this study aimed to outline current literature on PICC procedures, potential complications, and measures for prevention. Understanding evidence-based guidelines regarding insertion technique, early detection of complications, and care bundle of PICC is significant in complication prevention. Implementation of education, training, and appropriate multidisciplinary approaches on PICC care among nurses and caregivers is the key to preventing complications. Thus, the strict care of indwelling PICC lines, the targeted and reasonable PICC-associated complication prevention, and nursing care have a major clinical significance in reducing the occurrence of potential PICC complications.

24811591,2014,Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)-related thrombosis in critically ill patients. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) are being increasingly used in critical care setting. However, PICCs are associated with a number of complications, particularly upper extremity venous thrombosis (UEVT), leading to post-thrombotic syndrome, pulmonary embolism and increased risk of catheter-related infection. OBJECTIVE: To review the literature surrounding PICCs and highlight the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of PICC-related thrombosis in critically ill patients. DATA SOURCES AND EXTRACTION: We performed an electronic literature search of the databases PubMed, EMBASE and Google scholar using set search terms, from their commencement date to the end of January 2014. SUMMARY OF REVIEW: It has been shown that PICCs may double the risk of deep venous thrombosis compared with centrally inserted venous catheters, in critically ill patients. However, the incidence of PICC-related thrombosis in critically ill patients has not been quantified. Ultrasonography is the preferred diagnostic imaging modality. There are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the best treatment of PICC-related thrombosis in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting and in most cohort studies, anticoagulation strategies with or without PICC removal have been used. CONCLUSIONS: Decision to insert a PICC should be taken after careful risk stratification. There is lack of high-quality evidence assessing prevention strategies and management of PICC-related thrombosis in the ICU. Well-designed RCTs are required to estimate the prevalence of UEVT in ICU patients with PICCs and evaluate the efficacy and magnitude of clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of therapeutic strategies.

30697126,2019,Predictive risk factors of venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) in ambulant solid cancer patients: retrospective single Centre cohort study. ,"AIMS: Peripherally inserted central catheters(PICC) lines are becoming increasingly popular in solid cancer patients for the administration of chemotherapy. This study aims looking at the incidence of PICC line related and distant thromboembolism associated with these catheters and exploring risk factors. METHODS: Records were reviewed for 158 patients who underwent PICC line insertion over the two years period in the medical oncology unit, Milton Keynes University Hospital. The Incidence PICC line related Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) which is defined as upper extremity DVT at the site of PICC line insertion was documented after checking reports of ultrasound Doppler of all symptomatic patients to confirm the presence of thrombo-embolism and Computed Tomography(CT)scan or Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) to confirm the presence Pulmonary Embolism(PE). RESULTS: 23(13%) symptomatic patients with confirmed diagnosis by ultrasound Doppler were found to have PICC line related DVT and similar number of patients developed distant VTE, namely PE and lower limbs DVT. Average time to thrombo-embolism from the insertion of PICC line was 13 days and 51 days in distant VTE. Statistically significant results have been identified in the term of risk factors leading to VTE events during the period of PICC line insertion. CONCLUSIONS: VTE is a common complication in medical oncology patients who underwent insertion PICC line insertion for chemotherapy. Risk of distant VTE is high as well as the PICC line related DVT and the risk of the PICC line related DVT is higher in the first two weeks after PICC insertion. We concluded that high BMI,high PLTs count and Fluropyrimidine containing chemotherapy are all significant risk factors for VTE events recorded while smoking and high BMI are significantly contributing to the high rate of the PICC line related DVT.

28796444,2017,The Michigan Risk Score to predict peripherally inserted central catheter-associated thrombosis. ,"Essentials How best to quantify thrombosis risk with peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) is unknown. Data from a registry were used to develop the Michigan Risk Score (MRS) for PICC thrombosis. Five risk factors were associated with PICC thrombosis and used to develop a risk score. MRS was predictive of the risk of PICC thrombosis and can be useful in clinical practice. SUMMARY: Background Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are associated with upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). We developed a score to predict risk of PICC-related thrombosis. Methods Using data from the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium, image-confirmed upper-extremity DVT cases were identified. A logistic, mixed-effects model with hospital-specific random intercepts was used to identify factors associated with PICC-DVT. Points were assigned to each predictor, stratifying patients into four classes of risk. Internal validation was performed by bootstrapping with assessment of calibration and discrimination of the model. Results Of 23 010 patients who received PICCs, 475 (2.1%) developed symptomatic PICC-DVT. Risk factors associated with PICC-DVT included: history of DVT; multi-lumen PICC; active cancer; presence of another CVC when the PICC was placed; and white blood cell count greater than 12 000. Four risk classes were created based on thrombosis risk. Thrombosis rates were 0.9% for class I, 1.6% for class II, 2.7% for class III and 4.7% for class IV, with marginal predicted probabilities of 0.9% (0.7, 1.2), 1.5% (1.2, 1.9), 2.6% (2.2, 3.0) and 4.5% (3.7, 5.4) for classes I, II, III, and IV, respectively. The risk classification rule was strongly associated with PICC-DVT, with odds ratios of 1.68 (95% CI, 1.19, 2.37), 2.90 (95% CI, 2.09, 4.01) and 5.20 (95% CI, 3.65, 7.42) for risk classes II, III and IV vs. risk class I, respectively. Conclusion The Michigan PICC-DVT Risk Score offers a novel way to estimate risk of DVT associated with PICCs and can help inform appropriateness of PICC insertion.

31324590,2020,PICC management led by technicians: Establishment of a cooperation program with radiologists and evaluation of complications. ,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a cooperation program in order to compare incidence of complications after peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placement between radiologists and technicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PICC placement technique was standardized with ultrasound-guided puncture and fluoroscopic guidance. Numbers of PICC delegated to technicians, and PICC placement difficulties, were prospectively recorded for the whole study population whereas complications such as PICC infection, deep venous thrombosis and catheter occlusion were prospectively recorded until PICC removal for a subgroup of patients included during one month. RESULTS: A total of 722 patients had PICC placement. There were 382 men and 340 women with a mean age of 66.8±15.8 (SD) years (range: 18-94years); of these, 442/722 patients (61.22%) were included in the cooperation program with 433/722 patients (59.97%) who effectively had PICC placement by technicians and 289/722 (40.03%) by radiologists. Technicians needed radiologists' help for 23/442 patients (5.20%) including 6 failed PICC placement subsequently performed by radiologists. Twenty complications (20/77; 26%) were recorded in the subgroup of 77 patients studied for complications. No differences in complications rate were found between the 33 patients who underwent PICC placement by radiologists (6/33; 18%) and the 44 patients who underwent PICC placement by technicians (14/44; 32%) (P=0.296). Complications included 8 PICC-related infections (8/77; 10.4%), 3 deep venous thromboses (3/77; 3.9%) and 9 catheter occlusions (9/77; 11.7%). CONCLUSION: PICC placement led by technicians is feasible and safe without statistical difference in terms of complications compared to PICC placement made by radiologists.

36601900,2023,Effect of exercise therapy on PICC-associated venous thromboembolism: A meta-analysis. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) is widely used in clinical practice because of its long retention time and easy maintenance. However, PICC-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the most serious complication of PICC. Guidelines recommend exercise therapy to prevent PICC-associated VTE. However, inconsistent findings have been reported across the literature. This study conducted a meta-analysis to further evaluate the effect of exercise therapy on PICC-associated VTE. METHODS: We searched CNKI, Wanfang database, Chinese Science and Technology Journal Full Text Database, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases and included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of exercise therapy for the prevention of PICC-associated VTE. Two investigators independently screened the literature, extracted information, and evaluated the risk of bias for eligible RCTs. Meta-analysis was conducted by RevMan5.4 software. RESULTS: Eleven RCTs were included, including 1919 patients. Meta-analysis showed that the incidence of PICC-associated VTE was lower in the exercise therapy group than in the usual care group (RR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.22-0.41, p < 0.00001).Exercise therapy increased the axillary vein maximum velocity (SMD = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.58-1.28, p < 0.00001) and the axillary vein time-mean flow velocity (SMD = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.53-1.20, p < 0.00001). Subgroup analysis showed statistically significant differences for the incidence of PICC-associated VTE for intervention times<4 weeks (RR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.17-0.40, p < 0.00001) and intervention times≥4 weeks (RR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.22-0.54, p < 0.00001). For axillary vein maximum velocity, the difference was statistically significant for both intervention time <4 weeks (SMD = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55-0.91, p < 0.00001) and intervention time ≥4 weeks (SMD = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.18-2.19, p = 0.02). For axillary vein time-mean flow velocity, the intervention time <4 weeks (SMD = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.46-1.04, p < 0.00001), and the difference was statistically significant; while ≥4 weeks, the difference was not statistically significant (SMD = 1.14, 95% CI: -0.07 to 2.35, p = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Exercise therapy improved venous blood flow velocity and effectively reduced the incidence of PICC-associated VTE.

METHODS: Prospective observational study. All patients older than 14 years of age with a PICC inserted in the polyvalent intensive care unit (ICU) during the period between May 1, 2015 and April 30, 2016 were included. Data collected included: demographic data, insertion details, reason for insertion and removal, maintenance unit, total dwell time, incidence of complications and related factors and infection rate. RESULTS: 144 PICCs were inserted, of which 94 corresponded to the ICU group (65.28%) and 50 (34.72%) to the non-ICU group. The most important complication was the suspicion of infection: 17.36% (rate of 15.2 per 1000 days of PICC). The total number of confirmed infections was 6.25% (5.5 per 1000 days of PICC), 1.39% (1.2 per 1000 days) being in the ICU group and 4.86% (4.2 per 1000 days) in the non-ICU group. There were 5 bacteraemias, all in the non-ICU group (3 per 1000 days). The most frequent germ was Staphylococcus epidermidis (6 cases). Phlebitis had an incidence of 9.03% (7.9 per 1000 days of PICC). CONCLUSIONS: PICC, effective device for central venous access due to the minimal incidence of risks in implantation and to its advantages with regard to the classic central venous catheters, is a further nursing technique.

35802673,2022,Risk factors for early PICC removal: A retrospective study of adult inpatients at an academic medical center. ,"BACKGROUND: Use of PICCs has been rising since 2001. They are used when long-term intravenous access is needed and for blood draws in patients with difficult venous access. OBJECTIVE: To determine which risk factors contribute to inappropriate PICC line insertion defined as removal of a PICC within five days of insertion for reasons other than a PICC complication. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational study. SETTING: Tertiary-care, Level 1 trauma center. PATIENTS: Adult patients with a PICC removed 1/1/2017 to 5/4/2020. MEASUREMENTS: Frequency of PICC removal within five days of insertion and associated risk factors for early removal. RESULTS: Between 1/1/2017 and 5/4/2020, 995 of 5348 PICCs inserted by the IV nursing team were removed within five days (19%). In 2017, 5 of 429 PICCs developed a central line-associated infection (1.2%) and 29 of 429 PICCs developed symptomatic venous thromboembolism (6.7%). Patients with PICCs whose primary service was in an ICU were independently at higher risk of early removal (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.14, 1.83); weekday insertion was independently associated with a lower likelihood of early removal compared to weekend insertion (OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.49, 0.75). LIMITATION: PICC removal after discharge was not assessed and paper records were likely incomplete and biased. CONCLUSION: Nearly one in five PICCs were removed within five days. Patients whose primary team was in an ICU and PICCs ordered on weekends were at independently higher risk of early removal.

RESULTS: Among the 780 patients with breast cancer, 36 developed PICC-related venous thrombosis. The incidence of which was 4.62% (36/780). The PICC retention time ranged between 60 and 136 days, and the median time was 92 days. Thrombosis was found to occur within seven days after catheterization in three patients (8.33%), between 7 and 30 days in 18 patients (50%), between 31 and 92 days in 12 patients (33.3%), and ≥92 days in three patients (8.33%). Basilic vein puncture-induced thrombosis occurred in 25 patients (3.68%), and median cubital vein and cephalic vein puncture-induced thrombosis occurred in 11 patients (10.78%). The difference was statistically significant (P = 0.001). Thrombosis was not associated with age, punctured limb, platelet count, or chemotherapy drugs (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Blood vessel puncture was the main factor that affected PICC-related thrombosis in breast cancer chemotherapy. The basilic vein should be the primary choice for blood vessel puncture. Prolonged catheter retention does not increase the risk of thrombosis. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],[],['breast cancer' 'peripherally inserted central catheter' 'thrombosis']
34593288,2021,"""With a PICC line, you never miss"": The role of peripherally inserted central catheters in hospital care for people living with HIV/HCV who use drugs. ","BACKGROUND: People who use drugs (PWUD), and especially those who inject drugs, are at increased risk of acquiring bloodborne infections (e.g., HIV and HCV), experiencing drug-related harms (e.g., abscesses and overdose), and being hospitalized and requiring inpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy delivered through a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC). The use of PICC lines with PWUD is understood to be a source of tension in hospital settings but has not been well researched. Drawing on theoretical and analytic insights from ""new materialism,"" we consider the assemblage of sociomaterial elements that inform the use of PICCs. METHODS: This paper draws on n = 50 interviews conducted across two related qualitative research projects within a program of research about the impact of substance use on hospital admissions from the perspective of healthcare providers (HCPs) and people living with HIV/HCV who use drugs. This paper focuses on data about PICC lines collected in both studies. RESULTS: The decision to provide, maintain, or remove a PICC is based on a complex assemblage of factors (e.g., infections, bodies, drugs, memories, relations, spaces, temporalities, and contingencies) beyond whether parenteral intravenous antibiotic therapy is clinically indicated. HCPs expressed concerns about the risk posed by past, current, and future drug use, and contact with non-clinical spaces (e.g., patient's homes and the surrounding community), with some opting for second-line treatments and removing PICCs. The majority of PWUD described being subjected to threats of discharge and increased monitoring despite being too ill to use their PICC lines during past hospital admissions. A subset of PWUD reported using their PICC lines to inject drugs as a harm reduction strategy, and a subset of HCPs reported providing harm reduction-centred care. CONCLUSION: Our analysis has implications for theorizing the role of PICC lines in the care of PWUD and identifies practical guidance for engaging them in productive and non-judgemental discussions about the risks of injecting into a PICC line, how to do it safely, and about medically supported alternatives.

33719694,2022,Diagnosis and management of secondary malposition of PICC into the azygos vein. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) has been widely used. The catheter-related complications might occur and the reports of secondary malposition into azygos veins were rare. METHODS: This retrospective review summarized the experience in diagnosis and management of secondary malposition of PICC into azygos veins in 25 cases. RESULTS: When the catheter dysfunction occurred in the PICC on the left limb, it was necessary to consider whether there would be malposition into azygos veins after other reasons were excluded. The malposition could be diagnosed by chest lateral radiograph or chest computed tomography. The secondary malposition into azygos veins was resolved by repositioning or withdrawing the PICC. After re-inserting the catheter, it should be closely monitored whether the malposition occurred again. Intracavitary electrocardiogram positioning technology was used to confirm the catheter tip position before using corrosive drug. After the catheters withdrawn from the azygos veins, close attention should be paid to the property and concentration of the infusion drug strictly and the complications such as blockage and re-malposition. No serious complications such as infection, thrombosis and extravasation occurred in this group of patients after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggested that the right limb is recommended for PICC catheterization in order to avoid secondary malposition into azygos veins and the malposition into azygos veins should be dealt with in time.

36897677,2023,Quantified versus willful handgrip exercises for the prevention of PICC-related thrombosis: A meta-analysis and systematic review. ,"BACKGROUND: Thrombosis is a common yet serious complication in patients with peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC), the prevention of thrombosis is very important to the prognosis of PICC patients. We aimed to evaluate the effects of quantified versus willful grip exercises for the prevention of PICC-related thrombosis, to provide evidence to the clinical nursing care of PICC patients. METHODS: Two authors searched PubMed et al databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of quantified versus willful grip exercises in PICC patients up to August 31, 2022. Quality assessment and data extraction were independently performed by 2 researchers, and meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. RESULTS: 15 RCTs involving 1741 PICC patients were finally included in this meta-analysis. Synthesized outcomes indicated that compared with willful grip exercises, quantified grip exercises reduced the incidence of PICC-related thrombosis (odds ratio = 0.19, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.12-0.31) and infection (odds ratio = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.15-0.60) in PICC patients, increased the maximum venous velocity (mean difference = 3.02, 95% CI: 1.87-4.17) and mean blood flow (mean difference = 3.10, 95%CI: 1.57-4.62) in PICC patients (all P < .05). There were no publication biases amongst the synthesized outcomes (all P > .05). CONCLUSION: Quantified grip exercises can effectively reduce the occurrence of PICC-related thrombosis and infection, improve the venous hemodynamics. Limited by study population and regions, large-sample, and high-quality RCTs are still needed in the future to further evaluate the effects and safety of quantified grip exercises in PICC patients.

31937457,2020,Previous peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placement as a risk factor for PICC-associated bloodstream infections. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) -associated bloodstream infection (BSI) is a concern. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted to assess risk factors for PICC-associated BSI. RESULTS: A total of 1,215 cases and 31,874 catheter days were analyzed. In total, 54 cases of PICC-associated BSI were detected giving an infection rate of 1.69 per 1,000 catheter-days. The most frequently isolated pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (26%), followed by Enterococcus species (22%), Candida species (17%), and Staphylococcus aureus (11%). Multivariable analysis identified the significant risk factors for PICC-associated BSI as a prior PICC placement (odds ratio [OR], 2.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36-4.53), medical department admission (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.03-3.46), and older age (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00-1.05). With increasing frequency of previous PICC placement, the rates of PICC-associated BSI increased: 3.5% (31/883) without previous placement, 7.6% (13/171) in once, and 9.9% (9/32) in twice or more. DISCUSSION: The previous PICC placement was an independent risk factor for PICC-associated BSI and the risk proportionally rose with the increasing frequency of prior PICC placement. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with repeatedly inserted PICC should be managed more carefully for prevention and should be monitored for the development of PICC-associated BSI.

31895783,2020,Early mortality attributable to PICC-lines in 4 public hospitals of Marseille from 2010 to 2016 (Revised V3). ,"INTRODUCTION: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC-line) are devices inserted through peripheral venous access. In our institution, this technology has been rapidly adopted by physicians in their routine practice. Bacteremia on catheters remains an important public health issue in France. However, the mortality attributable to bacteremia on PICC-line remains poorly evaluated in France and in the literature in general. We report in our study an exhaustive inventory of bacteremia on PICC-line and their 30 days mortality, over a 7 years period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From January 2010 to December 2016, we retrospectively matched PICC-line registers of the radiology department, blood culture records of the microbiology laboratory and medical records from the Hospital Information Systems. RESULTS: The 11,334 hospital stays during which a PICC-line was inserted were included over a period of 7 years. Among them, 258 episodes of PICC-line-associated bacteremia were recorded, resulting in a prevalence of 2.27%. Hematology units: 20/324 (6.17%), oncology units: 55/1375 (4%) and hepato-gastro-enterology units: 42/1142 (3.66%) had the highest prevalence of PICC-line related bacteremia. The correlation analysis, when adjusted by exposure and year, shows that the unit profile explains 72% of the variability in the rate of bacteremia with a P = .023. Early bacteremia, occurring within 21 days of insertion, represented 75% of cases. The crude death ratio at 30 days, among patients PICC-line associated bacteremia was 57/11 334 (0.50%). The overall 30-day mortality of patients with PICC-line with and without bacteremia was 1369/11334 (12.07%). On day 30, mortality of patients with bacteremia associated PICC-line was 57/258 or 22.09% of cases, compared to a mortality rate of 1311/11076, or 11.83% in the control group (P < .05, RR 2.066 [1.54-2.75]). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a statistically significant excess mortality between patients with PICC-line associated bacteremia and PICC-line carriers without bacteremia (P < .0007, hazard ratio 1.89 [1307-2709]). CONCLUSION: Patients with PICC-line associated bacteremia have a significant excess mortality. The implementation of a PICC-line should remain the last resort after a careful assessment of the benefit/risk ratio by a senior doctor.

36717942,2023,Clinical factors associated with peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) related bloodstream infections: a single centre retrospective cohort. ,"BACKGROUND: Despite their spread in daily practice, few data is available on clinical factors associated with peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)-related bloodstream infections (PR-BSI). We aimed to assess the PR-BSI incidence, microbiology, and factors associated with PR-BSI with a focus on clinical symptoms. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in a French university hospital. We screened all PICC insertions performed from April 1st, 2018, to April 1st, 2019, and included PICC insertions in adult patients. We assessed the PR-BSI incidence, the factors associated with PR-BSI using a Cox model, and negative and positive predictive values (NPVs and PPVs) of each clinical sign for PR-BSI. RESULTS: Of the 901 PICCs inserted in 783 patients (38,320 catheters days), 214 PICCs (24%) presented with a complication. The most prevalent complication was PR-BSI (1.9 per 1000 catheter days; 8.1% of inserted PICCs ). Enterobacterales (N = 27, 37%) and coagulase negative Staphylococci (N = 24, 33%), were the main microorganisms responsible for PR-BSI. Factors independently associated with occurrence of PR-BSI were fever (hazard ratio 13.21, 95% confidence interval 6.00-29.11, p < 0.001) and chills (HR 3.66, 95%CI 1.92-6.99, p < 0.001). All clinical signs and a duration of PICC maintenance ≥ 28 days, had a low PPVs (≤ 67.1%) but high NPVs (≥ 92.5%) for PR-BSI. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring of clinical signs, especially fever and chills, with caution and limitation of device maintenance duration, could improve PICC management.

23715775,2014,Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) complications during pregnancy. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are routinely used in women with hyperemesis gravidarum. However, little is known about the consequences of PICC insertion in these patients. Our aim was to analyze PICC-related complication rates among pregnant women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pregnant women with PICC insertion between January 2000 and June 2006 were studied retrospectively. Infusate type, comorbid conditions, and PICC duration were characterized. Major complications, defined as need for surgical intervention, bacteremia requiring intravenous antibiotics, or thromboembolic events, were identified. Minor complications, including phlebitis, PICC malfunction, early PICC removal, infection requiring oral antibiotics, or hospitalization for PICC evaluation, were also studied. RESULTS: Eighty-four catheters in 66 women were eligible for study, totaling 2544 PICC days. Catheters remained in place for 1-177 days; median duration was 21.0 days. PICCs were used for intravenous fluid (IVF, 59.4%), parenteral nutrition (PN, 34.5%), and antibiotics (6%). The overall complication rate was 18.5 per 1000 PICC days (55.9% of PICCs); 22.6% were major, with bacteremia being most frequent (20.2%). A diagnosis of diabetes was the only factor that significantly predicted complications (hazard ratio, 2.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-6.13). PICC duration and type of infusate (PN vs IVF alone) were not associated with complications. CONCLUSIONS: PICC insertion in pregnant women is associated with a high complication rate, which appears to be independent of the type of infusate and occurs in the majority of women. PICCs should be used judiciously and only when clearly necessary during pregnancy. Further studies are needed to determine how to reduce PICC-related complications in this population.

36158127,2022,"Effects of Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) Catheterization Nursing on Bloodstream Infection in Peripheral Central Venous Catheters in Lung Cancer: A Single-Center, Retrospective Study. ","BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC), as one of the important intravenous routes for the rescue and treatment of critically ill patients, has been widely used in the fluid resuscitation of critically ill patients in intensive care. In particular, PICC can be widely used in the treatment of cancer patients. With the wide application of peripheral central venous catheterization, the clinical findings of bloodstream infection complications caused by PICC have gradually attracted the attention of doctors and patients. AIMS: To investigate the effect of specialized placement and PICC placement care on patients with lung cancer who underwent PICC puncture. Patients were selected and divided into a comparison group and an observation group of 40 patients each according to the randomized residual grouping method. In the comparison group, routine PICC placement and catheter maintenance were performed, while the observation group was provided with specialized placement and PICC placement care. The differences in immune and tumor marker levels and nursing compliance between the two groups were observed and compared before and after nursing care. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the comparison of tumor marker levels between the two groups of patients before care, while the levels of CYFRA21-1, CA125, and VGEF in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the comparison group after care, and this difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the comparison of immune levels between the two groups before care (P > 0.05), while the comparison of CD4+, CD3+, and CD4+/CD8+ after care was significantly different and higher in the observation group than in the comparison group, and the comparison was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The compliance rate of 93.8% in the observation group was significantly higher than that of 77.9% in the comparison group, and this difference was statistically significant for comparison (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: PICC placement care is more effective in patients with lung cancer and performing PICC puncture, significantly improves patients' immune and tumor marker levels, improves patients' negative emotions, reduces disease uncertainty, and improves nursing compliance.

26558650,2019,Use of Designated Nurse PICC Teams and CLABSI Prevention Practices Among U.S. Hospitals: A Survey-Based Study. ,"OBJECTIVES: The use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) has increased substantially within hospitals during the past several years. Yet, the prevalence and practices of designated nurse PICC teams (i.e., specially trained nurses who are responsible for PICC insertions at a hospital) are unknown. We, therefore, identified the prevalence of and factors associated with having a designated nurse PICC team among U.S. acute care hospitals. METHODS: We conducted a survey of infection preventionists at a random sample of U.S. hospitals in May 2013, which asked about personnel who insert PICCs and the use of practices to prevent device-associated infections, including central line-associated bloodstream infection. We compared practice use between hospitals that have a designated nurse PICC team versus those that do not. RESULTS: Survey response rate was 70% (403/575). According to the respondents, nurse PICC teams inserted PICCs in more than 60% of U.S. hospitals in 2013. Moreover, certain practices to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infection, including maximum sterile barrier precautions (93% versus 88%, P = 0.06), chlorhexidine gluconate for insertion site antisepsis (96% versus 87%, P = .003) and facility-wide insertion checklists (95% versus 87%, P = 0.02) were regularly used by a higher percentage of hospitals with nurse PICC teams compared with those without. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that nurse PICC teams play an integral role in PICC use at many hospitals and that use of such teams may promote key practices to prevent complications. Better understanding of the role, composition, and practice of such teams is an important area for future study.

36331967,2022,Barriers and facilitators for implementing peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) appropriateness guidelines: A longitudinal survey study from 34 Michigan hospitals. ,"Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are prevalent devices for medium-to-long-term intravenous therapy but are often associated with morbid and potentially lethal complications. This multi-center study sought to identify barriers and facilitators of implementing evidence-based appropriateness criteria to improve PICC safety and patient outcomes in a pay-for-performance model. Participating hospitals received an online toolkit with five recommendations: establishing a vascular access committee; implementing a clinical decision tool for PICC appropriateness; avoiding short-term PICC use (≤5 days); increasing use of single-lumen PICCs; and avoiding PICC placement in patients with chronic kidney disease. Longitudinal online surveys conducted biannually October 2014-November 2018 tracked implementation efforts. A total of 306 unique surveys from 34 hospitals were completed. The proportion of hospitals with a dedicated committee overseeing PICC appropriateness increased from 53% to 97%. Overall, 94% of hospitals implemented an initiative to reduce short-term and multi-lumen PICC use, and 91% integrated kidney function into PICC placement decisions. Barriers to implementation included: achieving agreement from diverse disciplines, competing hospital priorities, and delays in modifying electronic systems to enable appropriate PICC ordering. Provision of quarterly benchmarking reports, a decision algorithm, access to an online toolkit, and presence of local champion support were cited as crucial in improving practice. Structured quality improvement efforts including a multidisciplinary vascular access committee, clear targets, local champions, and support from an online education toolkit have led to sustained PICC appropriateness and improved patient safety.

Data were analysed using Review Manager (v5.3.0). A total of 10 RCTs and one case-control study were included. Meta-analysis results showed that PICC designs reduce the incidence of obstruction, and at the critical value of PICC-associated bloodstream infection, but may have no effects on other complications. Based on the literature reviewed, we can only say PICC new materials did not reflect significant reduction on complications, what's more, the result needs more multicentre, large RCTs to support. We suggested clinicians combine descriptive research and cost-effect analysis to select appropriate PICC materials and designs for patients.

We investigated the timing, frequency, and risk factors for PICC complications during treatment of PJI after THA and TKA. METHODS: We retrospectively queried an institutional database for THA and TKA patients from January 2015 through December 2020 that developed a PJI and required PICC placement at an academic, tertiary-care referral center. RESULTS: The study included 889 patients (48.3% female) with a mean age of 64.6 years (range, 18.7-95.2) who underwent 435 THAs and 454 TKAs that were revised for PJI. The cohort had 275 90-day ED visits (30.9%), and 51 (18.5%) were PICC related. The average time from discharge to PICC ED visit was 26.2 days (range, 0.3-89.4). The most common reasons for a 90-day ED visit were issues related to the joint replacement or wound site (musculoskeletal or MSK; n = 116, 42.2%) and PICC complaints (n = 51, 18.5%). A multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that non-White race (odds ratio [OR], 2.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-4.04; P = .007) and younger age (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.95-1.00; P = .035) were associated with PICC-related ED visits. Malposition/readjustment (41.2%) and occlusion (35.3%) were the most common PICC complications leading to ED presentation. CONCLUSIONS: PICC complications are common after PJI treatment, accounting for nearly 20% of 90-day ED visits.

34628865,2021,Risk factors for peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)-associated infections in patients receiving chemotherapy and the preventive effect of a self-efficacy intervention program: a randomized controlled trial. ,"BACKGROUND: A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) effectively reduces frequent vein punctures in cancer patients. With increasing clinical applications, PICC-associated infections are attracting increasing attention. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed PICC-associated infections in chemotherapy patients treated at our hospital in recent years to identify risk factors for PICC-associated infections and the preventive effect of a self-efficacy intervention program. METHODS: Using a convenience sampling method, we selected 159 cancer patients who received chemotherapy through a PICC at our hospital between July 2017 and December 2018, and the patients were randomly divided to an observation group (n=79) and a control group (n=80) using a random number table. The control group received conventional intervention, and the observation group received a self-efficacy intervention. We analyzed self-efficacy scores before and after the intervention, the complication rate, the infection rate, pathogens identified, and risk factors for PICC-associated infections. RESULTS: Among the 159 chemotherapy patients, 26 (16.35%) experienced PICC-associated infections in this finished trial. Univariate analysis showed that sex, puncture site, and steroid use were unrelated to PICC-associated infections (P>0.05), whereas PICC indwelling time, white blood cell (WBC) count, a history of diabetes, and immunity were significantly related to PICC-associated infections (P<0.05). The self-efficacy score improved after the intervention in both groups, especially in the observation group (P<0.05). The incidence of complications such as catheter infection, catheter blockage, and catheter displacement was significantly lower in the observation group than in the control group (16. 67% vs. 88.10%; P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The self-efficacy intervention improves self-management and reduces complications in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy through a PICC. PICC indwelling time, WBC count, a history of diabetes, and immunity are independent risk factors for PICC-associated infections; thus, measures should be implemented to prevent infections.

34540095,2021,Predisposing factors and effect of bundle nursing in PICC-related upper extremity deep venous thrombosis in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma undergoing chemotherapy. ,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of bundle nursing on PICC-related upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (PICC-UEDVT) in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who are undergoing chemotherapy, and contributing factors toward PICC-UEDVT. METHODS: 370 NHL patients undergoing chemotherapy in the Department of Hematology were selected prospectively and randomized into a control group (receiving routine nursing) and an observation group (receiving bundle nursing) using random number method. There were 185 patients in each group. The incidence of PICC-UEDVT and satisfaction rate towards nursing were calculated and risk factors for PICC-UEDVT were explored in the two groups. RESULTS: The incidence of PICC-UEDVT was lower in the observation group (18 patients, 9.73%) than that of the control group (35 patients, 18.92%; P<0.05); the satisfaction rate towards nursing was higher in the observation group than the control group (P<0.05). Tumor stage, ECOG score >2, hemoglobin <100 g/L, and D-dimer >0.5 mg/L were factors that contributed to the occurrence of PICC-UEDVT in NHL patients (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Tumor stage, ECOG score >2, reduced hemoglobin, and increased D-dimer levels are predisposing factors for PICC-UEDVT in NHL patients. However, bundle nursing can reduce the incidence of PICC-UEDVT and increase the satisfaction rate towards nursing.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From March 2017 to March 2020, patients with hematological diseases who received chemotherapy in our hospital were selected. The experimental group consisted of 80 patients with PICC, and the control group consisted of 70 patients with routine intravenous injection. The indwelling time, prevalence rate of adverse reactions, hemodynamic indicators before and after chemotherapy and compliance of patients in the two groups were compared. RESULTS: The longest time and average time of indwelling catheter in experimental group were significantly higher than those in control group (p<0.05). The total prevalence rate of adverse reactions in experimental group (3.75%) was significantly lower than that in control group (20%) (p<0.05). The compliance of patients with PICC in experimental group was significantly better than that of patients with superficial intravenous injection in control group. There was no significant difference in hemodynamic indicators between experimental group and control group before and after chemotherapy (p>0.05). There was significant difference in high-shear whole blood indicators, low-shear whole blood viscosity and high-shear whole blood viscosity after chemotherapy (p<0.05), while there was no significant difference in changes of other hemodynamic indicators (p>0.05) or in hemorheological indicators between the two groups after chemotherapy (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The total prevalence of adverse reactions in hematological diseases by PICC infusion is lower than that by superficial vein infusion, and the catheter has no significant influence on hemodynamic indicators in patients. Therefore, PICC catheter is worthy of application and promotion in hematological diseases.

34738565,2021,Peripherally Inserted Central Venous Catheters (PICC) versus totally implantable venous access device (PORT) for chemotherapy administration: a meta-analysis on gynecological cancer patients. ,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Ninety-four thousand gynecological cancer diagnoses are performed each year in the United States. The majority of these tumors require systemic adjuvant therapy. Sustained venous access was overcome by indwelling long-term central venous catheter (CVC). The best choice of which CVC to use is often arbitrary or dependent on physician confidence. This meta-analysis aims to compare PORT and peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) outcomes during adjuvant treatment for gynecological cancer. METHODS: Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) and the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses statement (PRISMA)were used to conduct the meta-analysis. RESULTS: 1320 patients were included, 794 belonging to the PORT group and 526 to the PICC group. Total complication rates were fewer in the PORT group, p = 0.05. CVC malfunction was less frequent in the PORT group than in the PICC group, p <0.01. Finally, thrombotic events were less expressed in the PORT group than in the PICC group, p = 0.02. No difference was found in operative complication, migration, malposition, extravasation, infection, and complication requiring catheter removal. CONCLUSIONS: PORT had fewer thrombotic complications and fewer malfunction problems than PICC devices. Unless specific contraindications, PORTs can be preferred for systemic treatment in gynecological cancer patients.

METHODS: A total of 90 patients with HMs treated with PICC catheterization in our hospital from October 2019 to October 2021 were included in the study. The patients were randomly assigned into experimental group (n = 45) and control group (n = 45). On the basis of the control group, the experimental group implemented the self-management education model based on the theory of protective motivation, and the control group implemented routine nursing health education measures. The self-nursing ability scale (ESCA), Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA), the average cost of PICC catheter maintenance, the incidence of PICC-related complications, and the score of Newcastle nursing satisfaction scale (NSNS) were observed 1 month before and after nursing. RESULTS: After one month of nursing, there was no significant difference in ESCA self-concept (p > 0.05). After one month of nursing, the scores of self-care responsibility, self-nursing skills, and health knowledge in the experimental group were significantly higher compared to those before nursing (p < 0.05) and higher compared to those in the control group (p < 0.05). After one month of nursing, the score of HAMA scale was significantly lower compared to that before nursing (p < 0.05), and the score of HAMA scale in the experimental group was lower compared to the control group (p < 0.05). After one month of nursing, the average cost of PICC pipeline maintenance in the test group was lower than that in the control group (p < 0.05). One month after nursing, the incidence of PICC-related complications in the experimental group was lower than that in the control group (p < 0.05). One month after nursing, the score of NSNS scale was significantly higher than that before nursing (p < 0.05). After one month of nursing, the score of NSNS scale in the experimental group was higher than that in the control group. CONCLUSION: The self-management education model based on protective motivation theory is effective in nursing patients with peripheral venous catheterization and PICC catheterization of HMs. It is more beneficial to promote patients' self-nursing management ability, reduce anxiety, reduce the average cost of PICC pipeline maintenance, reduce the incidence of PICC-related complications, and enhance nursing satisfaction.

METHODS: In total, 186 tumor patients who had an alginate dressing after PICC insertion were randomly divided into a control group, observation group one (OG1), and observation group two (OG2). The control group had their first dressing change 48 h after PICC insertion, while OG1 was after 72 h and OG2 was after 96 h after. Samples were taken at the dressing change from the insertion site and surrounding skin. The results of the bacterial culture were compared to investigate how the timing of the first dressing change affected catheter infection. RESULTS: Of the 186 patients, 29 had a positive bacterial culture. Of these, 10 were in the control group, 9 were in OG1, and 10 were in OG2. IBM SPSS Statistics 21.0 was adopted to analyze the correlation between the timing of the first dressing change and insertion site infection. No statistical significance between the timing of the first dressing change and insertion site infections was found (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The condition of each tumor patient should be comprehensively evaluated after PICC placement to determine when the first dressing change should occur, but it can likely be extended to 96 h after insertion to promote wound healing, reduce clinical workload, and lower patient economic burden.

25198814,2015,Percutaneous retrieval of PICC fractures via the femoral vein in six cancer patients. ,"PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility and safety of the interventional technique of retrieving the fractured peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) segments within the vessels via the femoral vein. METHODS: From July 2007 to January 2012, we performed percutaneous retrieval of PICC fractures in six cancer patients who accepted chemotherapy via PICC. The fractures occurred during the traction of the catheter and were diagnosed with chest plain film radiography and/or computed tomography. The patients included four cases of ovarian cancer, one case of breast cancer and one case of cervical cancer. The fractures were retained in the vessels of the patients for 1 to 10 days. According to the location of the ends of the PICC fractures, three methods were employed using the most commonly used interventional devices in the digital subtraction angiography suite. RESULTS: The PICC fractures were located in the subclavian vein, superior vena cava, right atrium, right ventricle or pulmonary arteries. During the procedures, a goose neck snare, pigtail catheter and stone basket catheter were used individually or in combination. The PICC fractures were removed successfully in all six patients via unilateral or bilateral femoral vein access. No major complications occurred during the operation or the follow-up period of 7 to 10 days. CONCLUSIONS: Via femoral vein access, PICC fractures could be removed with common interventional instruments such as a goose snare, basket catheter and pigtail catheter. The interventional retrieval is a safe, convenient and minimally invasive method for the removal of PICC fractures. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Administration, Intravenous' 'Adult' 'Aged'

29118410,2017,The microbiological characteristics and risk factors for PICC-related bloodstream infections in intensive care unit. ,"The study was aimed to investigate the pathogens distribution and risk factors for PICC-related bloodstream infection in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. 402 patients placed with PICC in ICU were recruited in the study. The microbiological characteristics of PICC-related infection were investigated by Vitek 2 Compact automated microbial system. Antibiotics sensitivity was performed with disk diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods. Multivariate logistic and cox analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for PICC-related infection in ICU patients. 38 PICC-related infection cases were observed, and its morbidity was 9.45%. The morbidity was significantly higher in power PICC cases than that in common PICC cases. Gram-positive bacteria might be responsible for the major infection cases, followed by gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. Drug sensitivity analyses indicated that gram-negative bacteria showed low resistance to carbapenems antibiotics, and Cefperazone/sulbactam. The gram-positive bacterial exhibited sensitive to Teicoplanin and Vancomycin. The isolated fungi showed low resistance to the commonly used antifungal antibiotics. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that power PICC, high Charison scores, diabetes mellitus, double lumens triple lumens were risk factors for PICC-related infections among ICU patients. Power PICC, high Charison scores, diabetes mellitus, multi-lumens are risk factors for PICC-related bloodstream infection in ICU patients.

33918869,2021,Comparison of the Quality of Life of Patients with Breast or Colon Cancer with an Arm Vein Port (TIVAD) Versus a Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC). ,"INTRODUCTION: Venous access is a crucial element in chemotherapy delivery. It remains unclear whether cancer patients prefer a port to a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC). Our study aimed to assess cancer patients' satisfaction with their venous access device and to compare the quality of life (QoL) of subjects with a PICC to those with a port. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, EORTC QLQ-C30, and a locally developed quality of life survey (QLAVD), designed to assess satisfaction with venous access devices, were administered to breast or colorectal cancer patients over a one-year period following the device insertion. Mixed effects models were used to assess changes on mean scores at different time points. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients were recruited over a three-year period, (PICC group, n = 50; port group, n = 51). Survey response rates for months one and three were 72% and 48%, respectively. Overall, no significant differences were noted between the two groups in relation to EORTC QOL. At three months, the mean pain scores were 3.5 ± 2.3 for the port and 1.3 ± 0.75 for PICC (<0.001). The mean score for a negative effect of the venous access device on psychosocial well-being was 6.0 ± 4.1 for PICC and 3.0 ± 2.7 for the port (p = 0.005). Complications related to PICCs occurred in 38% patients versus 41% with a port (p > 0.24). CONCLUSIONS: Although subjects with a port experienced more pain during the device insertion or access for chemotherapy, it had a smaller negative impact on psychosocial scores than the PICC.

34343419,2021,Comparing the accuracy and complications of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placement using fluoroscopic and the blind pushing technique. ,"INTRODUCTION: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) offer a convenient long-term intravenous access option. Different methods exist for insertion including the use of continuous fluoroscopy for guidance, or bedside insertion techniques. The blind pushing technique is a bedside approach which involves advancing a PICC through the access sheath without imaging guidance, before taking a mobile chest radiograph to confirm tip position. Obtaining optimal position is a critical aim of PICC placement as malpositioned lines have been associated with higher complications including death. We aimed to assess the accuracy of PICC placement by comparing the tip position and complications for lines placed under fluoroscopic guidance to those placed without fluoroscopic guidance. METHODS: The Radiology Information System was used to identify 100 continuous PICC insertions in each group (fluoroscopic and blind pushing) between 1 January and 12 May 2019. Patients were excluded if there was a known history of central venous occlusion/stenosis. RESULTS: In the fluoroscopic-guided group, 0% of the lines were malpositioned compared with 60% of the lines placed using the blind pushing technique, P < 0.001. Fluoroscopic-guided PICC insertions were in place for a total of 2446 days and demonstrated 6 complications (2.45 complications per 1000 catheter days). This compared with blind pushing technique PICC insertions which were in place for a total of 1521 days and demonstrated 18 complications (11.83 complications per 1000 catheter days), P = 0.004. CONCLUSION: The use of fluoroscopy for PICC placement leads to significant improvements in tip accuracy than for PICCs placed using the blind pushing technique. While the use of these imaging resources incurs cost and time, these factors should be balanced in order to offer patients the safest and most accurate method of line insertion.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a case‒control study. A total of 98 cancer patients undergoing PICC placement from January 2017 to December 2019 at the ICU Venous Access Center of Peking University Cancer Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. These included 47 cases in the thrombosis group and 51 cases in the nonthrombosis group according to the occurrence of PICC-related thrombosis within 90 days after the PICC procedure. RESULTS: a) RDW was significantly higher in the thrombosis group (15.98±1.93) than in the nonthrombosis group (13.98±1.09). Additionally, the number of smoking histories in the thrombosis group (18, 38.30%) was significantly higher than that in the nonthrombosis group (5, 9.80%). b) Logistic regression analysis indicated that RDW and smoking history were independent risk factors for PICC-related thrombosis (OR: 3.028, P<0.001; OR: 5.640, P=0.023). c) The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the combination of RDW and smoking history was 86.8%, and the sensitivity and specificity for predicting thrombosis after PICC were 85.1% and 80%, respectively. d) Cox regression analysis revealed that RDW and smoking history were independent risk factors for PICC-related thrombosis (p<0.001). e) Results from Kaplan‒Meier analysis showed that incidence of PICC-related thrombosis in patients with RDW less than 14.75% is significantly lower than those with RDW 14.75% and above (p<0.001). e) Baseline RDW was not different between the two groups (P>0.05), ΔRDW was significantly different between the two groups (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The combined use of RDW and smoking history has early evaluation and predictive value in the diagnosis of PICC-related thrombosis.

34723657,2021,Bridging the gap: introduction of an antimicrobial peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) in response to high PICC central line-associated bloodstream infection incidence. ,"OBJECTIVE: To reduce the incidence of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) in peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) through the introduction of an antimicrobial (AM) catheter as recommended in evidence-based guidelines and standards. DESIGN: Quality improvement project comparing incidence of infections pre-implementation and postimplementation of the new catheter. SETTING: A 582-bed community teaching hospital in Northwest Indiana. METHODS: Pre-implementation analysis of surveillance data indicated that 50% of CLABSIs occurred inpatients with PICCs in situ. A gap analysis was performed to review institutional practices against evidence-based recommendations. The use of an AM catheter was supported in each of the documents consulted. After introduction of the new device, performance was measured in a prospective manner using standardized Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) surveillance protocols for CLABSI and internal data sources for other measures. RESULTS: After 30 months of data collection, the PICC CLABSI incidence reduced from a baseline rate of 1.83/1000 PICC days to 0.162/1000 PICC days (91.15% reduction, P=0.0002). CONCLUSION: Combined with continued compliance with basic prevention strategies (ie use of a central line insertion checklist/insertion bundle) and optimization of device selection and lumen justification, the introduction of an antimicrobial/antithrombogenic (AM/AT) PICC was associated with a significant reduction in CLABSI.

It is very important to further explore the relationship among these features, so that prevent and treat the PICC-related thrombosis.To investigate the clinical features and the related factors of PICC-related upper extremity asymptomatic venous thrombosis in cancer patients, and to provide theoretical basis for the prevention of venous thrombosis.A total of 127 tumor patients with PICC catheterization were selected. Thrombus was detected by color Doppler ultrasound at different times: before catheterization and 24 hours after catheterization, and every week. The study was terminated at the time of thrombosis, and patients who did not develop thrombus were terminated after 6 weeks of follow-up. The clinical characteristics and influencing factors of asymptomatic thrombosis such as vessel diameter, blood flow velocity, thrombosis time, location, and the thrombosis stages were recorded.The incidence of PICC-related upper limbs asymptomatic thrombosis was 48.82% (62/127), and the median time was 3 days. The incidence within 24-hour was 37.1% and within 1 week was 85.49%. A total of 81 venous thrombosis were found in 62 patients with asymptomatic thrombosis, there were 19 (23.5%) venous thrombosis in the deep veins while 62 (76.5%) in the superficial veins. Furthermore, thrombosis stages can be divided into 3 levels: stage I accounted for 51.85% (42/81), stage II accounted for 37.04% (30/81), and stage III accounted for 11.11% (9/81). The group trajectory analysis indicated the 3 changes of blood flow velocity during the follow-up period: downward trend, upward trend, and steady fluctuations. Survival analysis indicated that the cohort with downward trend have the high risk of thrombosis (67.90% vs 19.00% vs 45.10%). Cox proportional hazards model suggested that the patient's Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score (hazard ratio [HR] 2.791, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.08-0.76) and blood flow velocity (HR 0.250, 95% CI 2.01-3.87) was the risk of PICC-related asymptomatic thrombosis.PICC catheterization can affect blood flow and asymptomatic thrombosis can occur at an early stage. Patient's upper limb activities should be guided to promoting blood circulation, thus effectively preventing thrombosis. Asymptomatic thrombosis can also be detected by color Doppler ultrasound system, within a recommended time of 1 week after catheterization.

27161689,2016,PO-02 - Retrospective audit of the Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) associated thrombosis in patients with haematological malignancies at Cork University Hospital. ,"INTRODUCTION: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) have been increasingly used for administration of chemotherapy, antibiotics and blood products in patients with haematological malignancies. Although generally regarded safe, infections and thrombotic events have occurred with PICC use, necessitating study to guide future clinical prophylaxis and management. AIM: 1) Determine the incidence of PICC associated thrombosis in patients with haematological malignancies 2) To identify clinically significant risk factors contributing to these complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cohort study, conducted in Cork University Hospital, between January 2010 and June 2015. After ethical approval Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) in radiology was used. All adult patients with PICC inserted under haematology were identified. A total of 90 patients with haematological malignancies who had PICC line placement were included. Patients' charts were reviewed in the medical record department. Data was collected using proforma sheets. This included patients demographs, type of malignancy, size of the PICC line, and total days of insertion. Haematological laboratory parameters were also recorded. The main outcome measures were PICC associated thrombosis and/or infection RESULTS: Of 131 PICC placements in a total of 90 patients. Out of these total PICC episodes 28.2% developed complications (n=37) and lead to removal. Thrombosis was found in 14.5% (n=19), 13.7% developed infection (n=18) and remaining were without complications. Of those with thrombosis (n=19), 7 patients had a diagnosis of Multiple Myeloma and 6 had Acute Myeloid Leukaemia. Whereas those with PICC associated infection (n=18), 5 had Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 5 had Acute Lymphoid Leukaemia. Diagnosis was significantly associated with complication (p=0.019). The mean age of patients who has PICC associated thrombosis was 51.6 years (±8.1 years). PICC removal as a result of complications was associated with increasing PICC lumen size; 30% of 5-French PICCs necessitated removal whereas 79.2% of 6-French PICCs necessitated removal (p=0.01). In addition, increased PICC lumen size was associated with clinically evident thrombophlebitis; 30% of 5-French PICCs displayed thrombophlebitis vs. 77%of 6-French PICCs displayed thrombophlebitis (p=0.017). Decreased in PICC lumen size was shown to influence the risk of complications; of 5 French catheters, 20% had thrombosis and 15% had infection, vs. 6 French catheters (13% and 13% respectively). Men were found to experience complications earlier with 80% of men having complications 1-50 days post PICC insertion and 12% 51-100 days post insertion. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of complications of PICC line insertion is relatively high in patients with haematological malignancies. Our institute thrombosis rate is similar to other studies. Haematological diagnosis was significantly associated with complication risk. Increased PICC lumen size was associated with higher removal rates as a result of complications and clinical signs of thrombophlebitis. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],[],[]
31724074,2020,Prospective observational study on the complications and tolerability of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) in neuro-oncological patients. ,"PURPOSE: The use of central venous catheters with peripheral insertion (PICC) has increased rapidly in recent years, particularly in cancer patients. The benefits provided may occasionally be affected by relevant complications, such as infections and thrombotic events, especially in neuro-oncological patients. To date, the risk of PICC-related complications in this subset of patients is unknown, as is tolerability. As a primary objective, this study aimed to collect complications related to PICCs in primary neuro-oncological patients. As a secondary objective, the study aimed to evaluate PICC tolerability. METHODS: Neuro-oncological patients with PICCs that were placed as part of normal clinical practice at IRCCS Neurologico C. Besta were consecutively enrolled in the study. PICC-related complications were recorded immediately (during the procedure), early (within 1 week after PICC insertion), and late (1-3-5 months after PICC placement). At the same time points, all patients were also evaluated for tolerability through interviews with semi-structured, open-ended questions. RESULTS: Sixty patients were enrolled (41 males and 19 females, with a median age of 56.2 years). Excluding loss to follow-up, 33/49 patients developed at least one complication related to the PICC. Immediate complications mainly included hematoma (8), accidental arterial puncture (4), and primary malpositioning (3). Regarding early and late complications, 3 device-related infections, 8 thrombotic events, and 20 mechanical complications were registered. Semi-structured interviews revealed an overall positive experience with the device. The most negative impact was on hygiene habits, with 34 patients becoming caregiver-dependent. Over time, almost all patients became used to the device and perceived greater security during chemotherapy. A strongly negative issue was the difficulty of relying on competently trained healthcare personnel in outpatient setting. CONCLUSION: The results showed a nonnegligible increased thromboembolic risk in neuro-oncological patients with PICCs, almost double that in historical oncological populations. It is essential to extend the study to a greater number of patients to achieve reliable results and to identify patients at high risk. The device seems to be positively accepted by the majority of patients, without affecting activities of daily living. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Adult' 'Aged' 'Aged, 80 and over'

This strategy has been established the latest years as a common approach in many clinical conditions. Apart from their usefulness, PICC use is related to some complications. Aim of this review is to summarize all relevant publications regarding the PICC-related infection, as sepsis remains a high mortality syndrome. We conducted a PubMed search to identify all relevant publications referring to infective complications after insertion and use of PICC lines in hospitalized adult patients. A great number of publications suggest that PICC lines are widely used in the management of patients. The use of peripheral inserted central lines is related with a few complications, including bloodstream infections. Existing data mainly support their use in specific clinical conditions because of the low infectious rates. Some conflicting data also exist regarding PICC use, due to an unclear benefit from their use compared to other commonly used strategies. Although a number of complications, including bloodstream infections are related with insertion of PICC lines, their use has a promising role and can be used when indicated in a wide variety of clinical conditions, especially in specific categories of patients and prolonged periods.

OBJECTIVES: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify the association between the levels of potential biomarkers that reflect the activation of the blood system, long-term vascular complications, inflammatory system, and the occurrence of PICC-related DVT. METHODS: Seven electronic databases (Embase, Web of Science, Medline, Scopus, Cinahl, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ERIC) were searched to identify literature published until December 2022. Studies were required to report: (I) adult and pediatric patients, outpatient or admitted to clinical, surgical, or ICU with PICC; (II) patients with PICC-related DVT and patients without PICC-related DVT as a comparator; and (III) at least one biomarker available. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of the studies. Study precision was evaluated by using a funnel plot for platelets level. We provided a narrative synthesis and meta-analysis of the findings on the biomarkers' outcomes of the studies. We pooled the results using random effects meta-analysis. The meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager software v5.4. This systematic review is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42018108871). RESULTS: Of the 3564 studies identified (after duplication removal), 28 were included. PICC-related DVT was associated with higher D-dimers (0.37 μg/mL, 95% CI 0.02, 0.72; p = 0.04, I(2) = 92%; p for heterogeneity < 0.00001) and with higher platelets (8.76 × 10(9)/L, 95% CI 1.62, 15.91; p = 0.02, I(2) = 41%; p for heterogeneity = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: High levels of D-dimer and platelet were associated with DVT in patients with PICC. However, biomarkers such as APTT, fibrinogen, FDP, glucose, hemoglobin, glycated hemoglobin, INR, prothrombin time, prothrombin fragment 1.2, the thrombin-antithrombin complex, and WBC were not related to the development of DVT associated with PICC.

35071472,2021,Effectiveness and safety of catheter removal alone versus standard anticoagulation therapy after catheter removal for peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)-related thrombosis. ,"BACKGROUND: Currently, peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are widely used; however, there are associated problems due to catheter-related thrombosis (CRT). According to the existing literature and guidelines, 3-6 months of anticoagulation therapy is recommended, but these recommendations are based on analogous deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs. More specific management strategies need to be developed, and the safety and effectiveness of these strategies needs to be investigated. METHODS: Some studies have suggested that catheter removal alone is a reasonable option, especially for patients with a higher risk of bleeding. We conducted a retrospective study of hospitalized patients from a single center who were diagnosed with PICC-related thrombosis. Among the 85 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 63 patients were treated with catheter removal alone, and 22 patients received anticoagulation therapy after catheter removal. The progression of thrombosis and bleeding in the two groups were compared. Most patients who underwent catheter removal alone had hematological malignancies, and thrombocytopenia had occurred during chemotherapy. RESULTS: After PICC removal, no patients in the anticoagulation therapy group developed progressive thrombosis, while 10 patients in the catheter removal alone group developed progressive thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (PE), including one case of PE, four cases of secondary upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT), and five patients showed obvious aggravation of thrombosis after catheter removal, and were administered repeated anticoagulant therapy. In the PICC removal + anticoagulation treatment group, major bleeding increased significantly (28.6% vs. 4.7%, P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the PICC removal + anticoagulation treatment group, the risk of major bleeding in the catheter removal alone group was significantly reduced. In some patients with an increased bleeding risk, catheter removal alone may be a safer and more effective option than catheter removal with anticoagulation treatment for CRT.

A systematic search of EMBASE, CINAHL, PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane was performed from inception to 4 June 2020. Meta-analysis was performed to determine the pooled incidence of asymptomatic PICC-RT. RESULTS: Ten studies comprising 1591 participants with 1592 PICCs were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled incidence of asymptomatic PICC-RT in adults was 22% (95% CI, 0.17-0.29). The pooled incidence of PICC-RT in cancer patients was 19% (95% CI, 0.13-0.26). Asymptomatic PICC-RT mainly occurred in superficial veins. Most asymptomatic thrombosis occurred 3-12 days after the PICC insertion. A higher Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score (ECOG), slower blood flow velocity and left basilic vein were independent risk factors of asymptomatic thrombosis.

This study explored the effects of tai chi on catheterrelated complications, catheter management ability, and quality of life in tumor patients with PICC at the intermission of chemotherapy. METHODS: This study was an open parallel trial. A total of 98 patients with malignant tumors who underwent long-term chemotherapy with PICC were randomly divided into an observation group (49 cases) and a control group (49 cases). The control group received grip strength exercise for 3 months, while the observation group received 24 simplified tai chi exercises. The coagulation function, thrombosis rate, self-management ability, and quality of life were compared between the two groups before and after the intervention. RESULTS: After the intervention, the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT) in the observation group were longer than those in the control group, while fibrinogen (FIB) was lower than that in the control group (all P<0.05). After the intervention, the total score of self-management ability of the observation group was higher than that of the control group (t=2.038, P=0.047), and the scores of exercises ability and quality of daily life with catheters were significantly increased (all P<0.05). In terms of quality of life, scores of role-physical (RP), social functioning (SF), mental health (MH) and role-emotional (RE) in the observation group were higher than those in the control group (all P<0.05), while there was no statistical difference between the bodily pain (BP) scores of the observation group and the control group (P>0.05). The incidence of venous thrombosis in the observation group was lower than that in the control group, the difference was statistically significant ( χ 2 =4.439, P=0.035).

","BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are associated with upper extremity-deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, patterns, risk factors and treatment associated with this event remain poorly defined. OBJECTIVE: To determine patterns, risk factors and treatment related to PICC-DVT in hospitalized patients. DESIGN, SETTING & PATIENTS: Between 2012-2013, consecutive cases of ultrasound-confirmed, symptomatic PICC-DVT were identified. For each case, at least two contemporaneous controls were identified and matched by age and gender. Patient- and device-specific data were obtained through electronic-medical records. Using variables selected a priori, multivariable logistic regression models were fit to the outcome of PICC-DVT, comparing cases to controls. RESULTS: 909 adult hospitalized patients (268 cases, 641 controls) were included in the study. Indications for PICC placement included long-term intravenous antibiotic therapy (n=447; 49.1%), in-hospital venous access for blood draws or infusion of medications (n=342; 44.2%), and total parenteral nutrition (n=120; 6.7%). Patients with PICC-DVT were more likely to have a history of venous thromboembolism (OR 1.70, 95% CI=1.02-2.82) or have undergone surgery while the PICC was in situ (OR 2.17, 95%CI=1.17-4.01 for surgeries longer than two hours). Treatment for PICC-DVT varied and included heparin bridging, low molecular weight heparin only and device removal only; the average duration of treatment also varied across these groups. Compared to 4-Fr PICCs, 5- and 6-Fr PICCs were associated with greater risk of DVT (OR 2.74, 95%CI=0.75-10.09 and OR 7.40 95%CI=1.94-28.16, respectively). Patients who received both aspirin and statins were less likely to develop PICC-DVT than those that received neither treatment (OR 0.31, 95%CI=0.16-0.61). Receipt of pharmacological DVT prophylaxis during hospitalization showed a non-significant trend towards reduction in risk of PICC-DVT (OR=0.72, 95%CI=0.48-1.08). CONCLUSION: Several factors appear associated with PICC-DVT. While some of these characteristics may be non-modifiable, future studies that target potentially modifiable variables to prevent this adverse outcome would be welcomed.

31098669,2019,Which is Better for Patients with Breast Cancer: Totally Implanted Vascular Access Devices (TIVAD) or Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC)? ,"BACKGROUND: Our aim was to compare the applications of totally implanted vascular access devices (TIVAD) and peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) in breast cancer patients. METHODS: We analyzed 4080 cases of TIVAD and 1433 cases of PICC at the Breast Center of the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University. The success rate, operation time, and procedures of catheterization, as well as the catheterization-related complications, catheter indwelling-related complications, and the utilization conditions were compared between these two methods. RESULTS: Our results showed that the success rate of catheterization was relatively higher in PICC group (99.5%) than the TIVAD group (99.0%)(χ(2) = 3.521, P = 0.038), and the operation time and the rate of catheterization-related complications were lower in PICC (18.65 ± 4.7603 min, 0.91%) compared to TIVAD (29.55 ± 4.0843 min, 1.59%)(t = 38.000, P < 0.01, χ(2) = 3.578, P = 0.035). However, the rate of catheter indwelling-related complications was lower in TIVAD group (2.47%) than the PICC group (3.62%)(χ(2) = 5.227, P = 0.016), and the catheter care was also better in TIVAD.

METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the systematic use of PICC in 37 consecutive patients returning home after HSCT. RESULTS: In 6 out of 37 patients, the PICC was exclusively used for weekly blood controls. In 31 patients, the PICC line was used at home for hydration (18), antibiotics (3), intravenous human Ig (7), transfusions (10), extracorporeal photopheresis (3), chemotherapy (2), artificial nutrition (1), and/or palliative care (1). PICC complications were reported in ten patients (27%), causing eight PICC removals. At the end of the study, 35 patients had their PICC removed. PICCs were used with a median duration of 67 days. Reasons for removal were that PICC was not considered to be useful any longer (16), suspicion of infection (inflammation without documentation) (5) or infection (2), patient's wish (4), death (4), accidental withdrawal (2), puncture site bleeding (1), and catheter change due to extracorporeal photopheresis (1). Three venous thromboses were reported (8%), requesting one PICC removal because of associated infection. In other cases, an antithrombotic treatment was initiated. CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of patients included in the study was small, our results suggest that PICC is a safe long-term venous access for home care after HSCT.

We investigated the association between upper limb lymphedema and the risk of peripherally inserted central catheterrelated thrombosis (PICC-RT) occurring in the contralateral limb of patients with breast cancer. A retrospective review analyzed all patients with breast cancer who underwent PICC insertion at a cancer hospital in Hunan Province from 2015 to 2019. Upper limb lymphedema was indexed from hospital information system (HIS) before the occurrence of PICC-RT developed in the contralateral limb. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the association of factors with outcome. A total of 1,262 patient records were found and 50 cases of PICC-RT were identified. Forty of these occurred in patients without lymphedema (n=1,236) and 10 in patients with upper limb lymphedema (n=26). After adjustment for various co-variables, Cox regression analysis showed that upper limb lymphedema was significantly associated with increased risk of PICC-RT (hazard ratio=12.128, 95% confidence interval=5.551-26.501; P<0.001). In breast cancer patients, upper limb lymphedema may be an important predictor for PICC-RT in the contralateral limb and information should be provided to patients.

In active cancer, we assessed the Khorana risk score (KRS) and Michigan risk score (MRS) for predicting PICC thrombosis and modifications to improve discriminative accuracy. METHODS: We reviewed consecutive cancer patients receiving chemotherapy through a PICC inserted April 2017 to July 2018. For each case, we identified a contemporaneous non-cancer control. RESULTS: Among 147 cancer patients, median age 64 years, PICC duration 70 days (range, 2-452), 7% developed PICC thrombosis (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.6-12.2) and 4% (95% CI 2-9) PE/DVT. Among 147 controls, median age 68 years, PICC duration 18.3 days (range, 0.5-210), 0.7% (95% CI 0-4) developed PICC thrombosis and 2% (95% CI 0.4-6) PE/DVT. In our cancer cohort, no KRS < 1 patients developed PICC thrombosis (95% CI 0-11) compared with 9% (95% CI 5-16) in KRS ≥ 1 (P = 0.12). PICC thrombosis occurred in 4.7% (95% CI 1.5-11.7) MRS ≤ 3 compared with 10.9% (95% CI 4.1-22.2) MRS > 3 (P = 0.32). The addition of thrombocytosis, a variable from KRS, to MRS (modified MRS (mMRS)) improved discriminative value for PICC thrombosis (c-statistic MRS 0.63 (95% CI 0.44-0.82), mMRS 0.72 (95% CI 0.58-0.85)). PICC thrombosis occurred in 1.4% (95% CI 0-8.3) mMRS ≤ 3 and 11.8% (95% CI 6.1-21.2) mMRS > 3 (P = 0.02). More patients were categorised as low risk using mMRS ≤ 3 (47%) than KRS < 1 (22%). CONCLUSION: Cancer patients had longer PICC durations and higher PICC thrombosis rates than those without (7% vs 0.7%). mMRS more accurately classified low PICC thrombosis risk than KRS <1(47% vs 22%).

27373537,2016,The dwell time and survival rates of PICC placement after balloon angioplasty in patient with unexpected central venous obstruction. ,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the dwell time and actual survival rates of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placements after balloon angioplasty in patients with unexpected central venous obstructions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were obtained on all PICC insertions performed in a tertiary care hospital from August 2008 to December 2013. Thirty-five PICCs attempted after balloon angioplasty in 25 patients (15 male and 10 female patients; mean age, 63 years). Fisher's exact test was used to test for differences in reasons for catheter removal between the groups of patients with stenosis or obstructions. Survival curves for PICC dwell time of all patients, stenosis group, and obstruction group were generated separately using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and compared with log-rank tests. RESULTS: There were a total 21 obstructions and 14 stenoses. The overall technical success rate of PICC placement after balloon angioplasty was 94% (33 of 35 procedures). The PICC dwell time was determined for 27 PICCs and ranged from 4 to 165 days (mean, 39.6 days). Among all PICCs, 16 were removed early, resulting in an actual survival rate of 40.7% (11 of 27 PICCs). There were no significant differences in reasons for catheter removal between the stenosis and obstruction groups (p = 0.24). The dwell times for both groups were not significantly different by Kaplan-Meier analysis (p = 0.54). CONCLUSIONS: PICC placement after balloon angioplasty is a good treatment option for patients with unexpected central venous lesions, and offers high technical success rates. The actual survival rate was relatively lower (40.7%) than that from previous studies. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Adult' 'Aged' 'Aged, 80 and over' '*Angioplasty, Balloon'

36438461,2022,Peripherally Inserted Central Line Catheters following Hand and Wrist Infections. ,"Hand and wrist infections may cause varying degrees of morbidity requiring antibiotic therapy of variable duration and often operative intervention. Peripherally inserted central line catheters (PICCs) are placed when an extended course of intravenous antibiotics is anticipated. The present study aims to analyze utilization and impact of PICC placement on the management of hand, wrist, and forearm infections. METHODS: The PearlDiver Patients Records Database was queried to identify patients who underwent treatment for infection of the hand, wrist, and forearm between 2010 and 2018. Logistic regression analysis was utilized to evaluate the association of patient-related risk factors with PICC utilization, complications, readmissions, and length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: A total of 24,665 patients with an upper extremity infection were included in the study. Ultimately, 416 patients required a PICC placement (1.69%). Patients with older age, male gender, certain medical comorbidities, and infection involving deeper structures were more likely to require a PICC. Ninety-day all-cause medical complication rates were significantly higher for the PICC group (19.7% versus 6.7%) compared to those without. Any hospital readmission rates were significantly higher for PICC group at 90 days (28.4% versus 6.3%) and 1 year (35.8% versus 10.9%). Readmission rates remained slightly higher at 1 year for both groups. The PICC group demonstrated significantly longer LOS by 2 days (7.72 days versus 5.14 days). CONCLUSION: While not required for the majority of hand, wrist, and forearm infections, PICC placement is associated with increased medical complications, more frequent hospital readmissions, and longer LOS.

35216538,2023,Vascular access unit: Six-years experience report in France. ,"BACKGROUND: The role of nurses in peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) placement has been limited in France. Having a fully trained nurse-led PICC team can positively impact nursing profession and make better use of valuable human and economic healthcare resources. It can also improve the standards of patient's care, procedural experience, and safety. AIM: The aim of this article is to report the successful outcomes of nurse-led PICC team performed over a 6-year period from a single central hospital in France. METHODS: The authors reviewed all PICCs insertions performed by their trained nurse led team between 2014 and 2019. All quantitative and qualitative variables were considered: the patients admitted, the type of PICC inserted, overall procedural time, the mentor's help, the insert failures, the number of punctures required, the procedural pain utilizing Visual Analog Scale (VAS), any procedural complications, chest X-rays needed, the follow up to the eighth day (D8). RESULTS: From 2014 to 2019, 12,687 PICC were inserted with 128 failed procedures (1%). In 2019, 73% of procedural insertion time was less than 10 min. The request of support rapidly decreased to 2 calls/month. More than 90% of procedures were associated with mild pain (VAS ⩽ 3). After the first month of training, 81% of all procedures were performed with a single insertion puncture. Accidental artery puncture during procedure was 0.5%. The authors found room for improvement, progressing from 97% in the first year to 99% in 2019. Furthermore, the authors found that only 1.85% of all catheters developed local infection within D8, and only 0.83% evolved in vein thrombosis. Total bloodstream infection was at 0.1%. CONCLUSION: The authors report successful outcomes from data collected during the 6-year period demonstrating clear benefits of a nurse-led vascular access team with regard to system wide efficiencies and patient satisfaction.

36597793,2022,Safety and Efficacy of Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter Placement by Surgical Intensivist-Led Vascular Access Team. ,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bedside peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placement under ultrasonography (USG) guidance in the general ward by a surgical intensivist-led vascular access team versus that of PICC placement in the intensive care unit (ICU) or fluoroscopy unit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted this retrospective study of all patients who underwent PICC placement between March 2021 and May 2022. Clinical, periprocedural, and outcome data were compared for PICC placement in the ICU, general ward, and fluoroscopy unit groups, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 354 PICC placements were made in 301 patients. Among them, USG-guided PICC placement was performed in 103 and 147 cases in the ICU and general ward, respectively, while fluoroscopy-guided PICC placement was performed in 104 cases. USG-guided PICC placement more often required post-procedural catheter repositioning than fluoroscopy-guided PICC placement (P<0.001), but there was no significant difference in any adverse events (P=0.796). In addition, USG-guided PICC placement in the general ward was more efficient than fluoroscopy-guided PICC placement (0.73 days vs. 5.73 days, respectively; P<0.001). In the multivariate analysis, previous PICC placement within 6 months was an independent risk factor for a PICC-associated bloodstream infection (odds ratio, 2.835; 95% confidence interval, 1.143-7.034; P=0.025). CONCLUSION: USG-guided PICC placement in the general ward by a surgical intensivist-led vascular access team has comparable safety and efficiency to that of USG-guided PICC placement in the ICU or fluoroscopy-guided PICC placement.

33148905,2020,Safe central venous catheters for esophageal cancer treatment. ," Introduction : Central venous catheter (CVC) use is essential for treating esophageal cancer. Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) are commonly used recently for improved patient comfort and safety. We compared centrally inserted central catheters (CICC) and PICC insertions and examined their safety. Methods : We retrospectively investigated complications at the catheter insertion and post-insertion for 199 patients' esophageal cancer treatment (CICC : 45, PICC : 154) from 2013 to 2018. In addition, we summarized the results of catheter tip culture. Results : No serious complications occurred at the catheter insertion in either group. The rate of complications at catheter insertion was 5.8% for PICC and 6.7% for CICC patients. Post-insertion complications were observed in 6.5% and 11.1% of patients with PICC and CICC, respectively, and this difference was not significant. The incidence of catheter-related blood stream infection (CRBSI) was significantly lower in PICC than CICC patients (0.3 vs. 1.8 / 1,000 catheter-days ; p = 0.029). Catheter-related thrombosis was observed in PICC : 0.5 and CICC : 0.6, and occlusion due to blood flow reversal was observed in PICC : 0.5 and CICC : 0.6. Conclusion : PICCs are safer and more effective than CICCs for the treatment of esophageal cancer, and reduce the incidence of CRBSI. We hope to standardize the insertion procedures, conventionalize techniques, and establish training systems. J. Med. Invest. 67 : 298-303, August, 2020.

25910751,2015,Catheter-associated bloodstream infections and thrombotic risk in hematologic patients with peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC). ,"PURPOSE: The use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) as an alternative to other central venous access devices (CVAD) is becoming very frequent in cancer patients. To evaluate the impact of complications associated to these devices in patients with hematologic malignancies, we revised the catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) and the catheter-related thrombotic complications (CRTC) observed at our institute between January 2009 and December 2012. METHODS: A total of 612 PICCs were inserted into 483 patients at diagnosis or in subsequent phases of their hematologic disease. PICCs were successfully inserted in all cases. The median duration of in situ PICC placement was 101 days (interquartile range, 48-184 days). RESULTS: A CRBSI occurred in 47 cases (7.7 %), with a rate of 0.59 per 1000 PICC days. A CRTC was recorded in 16 cases (2.6 %), with a rate of 0.20 per 1000 PICC days. No serious complication was associated to these events. Cox regression analyses of variables associated to CRBSIs and to CRTCs showed that only the type of disease (acute leukemia compared to other diseases) was significantly associated to a higher incidence of CRBSIs, while no feature was predictive for a higher risk of CRTCs. CONCLUSIONS: PICCs represent a useful and safe alternative to conventional CVAD for the management of patients with hematologic malignancies.

25593110,2015,The catheter to vein ratio and rates of symptomatic venous thromboembolism in patients with a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC): a prospective cohort study. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are a common vascular access device used in clinical practice. Their use may be complicated by adverse events such as venous thromboembolism (VTE). The size of the vein used for PICC insertion and thus the catheter to vein ratio is thought to be a controllable factor in the reduction of VTE rates in patients who have a PICC. However, an optimal catheter to vein ratio for PICC insertion has not previously been investigated to inform clinical practice. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of the catheter to vein ratio (proportion of the vein measured at the insertion point taken up by the catheter) on rates of symptomatic VTE in patients with a PICC and identify the optimal ratio cut-off point to reduce rates of this adverse event. METHOD: Adult patients waiting for PICC insertion at a large metropolitan teaching hospital were recruited between May and December 2013. Vein diameter at the PICC insertion site was measured using ultrasound with in-built callipers. Participants were followed up at eight weeks to determine if they developed symptomatic VTE. RESULTS: Data were available for 136 patients (50% cancer; 44% infection; 6% other indication for PICC). Mean age was 57 years with 54% males. There were four cases of confirmed symptomatic VTE (two involving the deep veins, one peripheral vein and one pulmonary embolism). Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis determined that a 45% catheter to vein ratio was the ideal cut off point to maximise sensitivity and specificity (AUC 0.761; 95% CI 0.681-0.830). When a ratio of 46% or above was compared to one that was less than or equal to 45% using a log binomial generalised linear model it was found that participants with a catheter to vein ratio >45% were 13 times more likely to suffer VTE (relative risk 13, p=0.022; CI 1.445-122.788). CONCLUSION: It was found that a 45% catheter to vein ratio was the optimal cut off with high sensitivity and specificity to reduce the risk of VTE. However, further research is needed to confirm these results as although adequately powered; the number of cases of VTE was comparatively small, resulting in wide confidence intervals.

38111938,2023,Peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation at the crossroads of peripapillary myopic changes. ,"AIM: To analyze the prevalence of peripapillary intra-choroidal cavitation (PICC) in eyes with gamma peripapillary atrophy (γPPA), in eyes with peripapillary staphyloma (PPS) and in those combining γPPA and PPS and to analyze border tissue discontinuity in PICC. METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional non interventional study included highly myopic eyes. Non-highly myopic eyes were used as control. Radial and linear scans centered on the optic nerve head were performed using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Variables were analyzed along the twelve hourly optical coherence tomography sections in both eyes of each subject. RESULTS: A total of 667 eyes of 334 subjects were included: 229 (34.3%) highly myopic eyes and 438 (65.7%) non highly myopic eyes. The mean age of the highly myopic group was 48.99±17.81y. PICC was found in a total of 40 eyes and in 13.2% (29/220) of highly myopic eyes. PICC was found in 10.4% (40/386) of eyes with γPPA, in 20.5% (40/195) of eyes with PPS and in 22.7% (40/176) of those combining γPPA and PPS. All the eyes with PICC showed the co-existence of γPPA and PPS whereas none of the eyes presenting only one of these entities exhibited PICC. A border tissue discontinuity in the γPPA area was found in all eyes with PICC. CONCLUSION: We confirm the presence of a border tissue discontinuity in the γPPA area of all eyes with PICC. These findings suggest the involvement of mechanical factors in the pathogenesis of PICC which may contribute to PICC-related visual field defects.

35126715,2022,Construction of a rabbit model with vinorelbine administration via peripherally inserted central catheter and dynamic monitoring of changes in phlebitis and thrombosis. ,"Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are used for the administration of chemotherapy drugs, including vinorelbine. The present study aimed to construct a rabbit model with vinorelbine administration via PICC, and to dynamically monitor the formation of phlebitis and thrombosis. PICC was inserted into 48 rabbits following specific clinical procedures. The rabbits were randomly divided (n=6 per group) into the following eight groups: i) Control (PICC in place for 1 day); ii) 2nd day of PICC placement (received the first cycle of vinorelbine administration); iii) 3rd day of PICC placement; iv) 7th day of PICC placement; v) 14th day of PICC placement; vi) 21st day of PICC placement; vii) 23rd day of PICC placement (received the second cycle of vinorelbine administration); and viii) 24th day of PICC placement. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed on catheter, ear vein and anterior vena specimens. Prothrombin time was measured using an automatic coagulation analyzer, followed by routine blood tests. Serum levels of inflammation- and thrombosis-related factors, including C-reactive protein, D-dimer, interleukin-2, interleukin-6, P-selectin and E-selectin, were measured using ELISAs. X-ray examination confirmed that the rabbit model with vinorelbine administration via PICC was successfully constructed. On the 1st and 23rd day of PICC placement, thrombosis was observed in the catheter. Furthermore, on the 1st day of PICC placement, thrombosis was clearly observed in the ear vein and anterior vena samples. After vinorelbine administration, phlebitis occurred in the ear vein and anterior vena cava samples. With increasing time after vinorelbine administration via PICC, thrombosis and phlebitis were notably ameliorated. Moreover, on the day of vinorelbine administration, prothrombin time was significantly decreased and the serum levels of inflammation- and thrombosis-related factors were significantly increased compared with previous days. Collectively, the present study observed the formation and specific evolution of phlebitis and venous thrombosis after vinorelbine administration, providing a reference for the early prediction, timely prevention and treatment of PICC-related chemotherapy complications.

32441173,2022,Complications of peripherally inserted central catheters in pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis. ,"INTRODUCTION: Complication rates associated with peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in the general population are variable, and rates specific to pregnant women are unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the rate of PICC-associated complications in pregnant women. METHODS: We searched published literature for records discussing PICC use in pregnant or postpartum women. We included studies with primary data regarding rates of maternal complications from PICC use. The primary outcomes were maternal infection (cellulitis, sepsis), venous thromboembolism (VTE), or combined major complication rate. Secondary outcomes were superficial thrombophlebitis or mechanical failure. Meta-analysis was performed using STATA 12 with the METAN and METAPROP software routines. Pooled estimates with 95%CI were calculated using random-effects models. RESULTS: After the removal of duplicates, the primary search yielded 318 articles, with 5 being included for final analysis. The pooled rate of combined infectious and thromboembolic complications was 26% (95%CI = 6-53%). For secondary outcomes the pooled rate of infectious complications was 18% (95%CI = 4-39%), VTE 6% (95%CI = 0-18%), mechanical failure 7% (95%CI = 3-12%), and superficial thrombophlebitis 1% (95%CI = 0-3%). There was significant statistical heterogeneity between studies for all outcomes calculated. CONCLUSION: There are limited data regarding complication rates due to PICC use in pregnancy, with a high level of heterogeneity among existing studies. The risk of VTE appears comparable to PICC-associated VTE in the non-pregnant hospitalized population. The risk of infection associated with PICC use was the most variable, with rates ranging from 4% to 37%. This suggests that infection risk may be modifiable and further studies are needed to assess interventions that may lower this risk.

33782091,2022,Improving peripherally inserted central catheter appropriateness and reducing device-related complications: a quasiexperimental study in 52 Michigan hospitals. ,"BACKGROUND: The Michigan Appropriateness Guide for Intravenous Catheters (MAGIC) provides evidence-based criteria for peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) use. Whether implementing MAGIC improves PICC appropriateness and reduces complications is unknown. METHODS: A quasiexperimental study design to implement MAGIC in 52 Michigan hospitals was used. Data were collected from medical records by trained abstractors. Hospital performance on three appropriateness criteria was measured: short-term PICC use (≤5 days), use of multilumen PICCs and PICC placement in patients with chronic kidney disease. PICC appropriateness and device complications preintervention (January 2013 to December 2016) versus postintervention (January 2017 to January 2020) were compared. Change-point analysis was used to evaluate the effect of the intervention on device appropriateness. Logistic regression and Poisson models were fit to assess the association between appropriateness and complications (composite of catheter occlusion, venous thromboembolism (VTE) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)). RESULTS: Among 38 592 PICCs, median catheter dwell ranged from 8 to 56 days. During the preintervention period, the mean frequency of appropriate PICC use was 31.9% and the mean frequency of complications was 14.7%. Following the intervention, PICC appropriateness increased to 49.0% (absolute difference 17.1%, p<0.001) while complications decreased to 10.7% (absolute difference 4.0%, p=0.001). Compared with patients with inappropriate PICC placement, appropriate PICC use was associated with a significantly lower odds of complications (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.34), including decreases in occlusion (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.29), CLABSI (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.81) and VTE (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.47, all p<0.01). Patients with appropriate PICC placement had lower rate of complications than those with inappropriate PICC use (incidence rate ratio 0.987, 95% CI 0.98 to 0.99, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of MAGIC in Michigan hospitals was associated with improved PICC appropriateness and fewer complications.

","PURPOSE: To compare the effectiveness and safety of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and peripherally inserted central catheter (PTA + PICC), contralateral PICC, and midline catheterization (MC) in patients with venous stenosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 7,327 PICC procedures were performed in 5,421 patients at a single institution between 2013 and 2019. Among them, 87 patients had upper-arm venous stenoses and were managed with PTA + PICC, contralateral PICC, or MC. Data on catheter-dwell time, clinical success rate, and adverse events were recorded. The procedure was considered to have clinically succeeded when a PICC was removed from the patient just before discharge or after the completion of therapy. Catheter survival time and the chance of adverse events were compared among the groups using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. RESULTS: PTA + PICC, contralateral PICC, and MC procedures were performed for 57 (65.5%, 57/87), 10 (11.5%, 10/87), and 20 (23.0%, 23/87) patients, respectively. The mean catheter-dwell time in the PTA + PICC, contralateral PICC, and MC groups was 49.7, 28.7, and 15.1 days, respectively, and the clinical success rate of each group was 86.0% (49/57), 80.0% (8/10), and 50.0% (10/20). The PTA + PICC group had a significantly longer catheter survival time than the MC group (P < .001). The chance of a catheter-related infection (P = .008) was significantly lower in the PTA + PICC group than in the MC group. CONCLUSIONS: PTA + PICC or contralateral PICC should be considered prior to ipsilateral MC when venous stenosis is encountered during PICC procedures.

While the risks of central line associated blood stream infections (CLABSI) in burn patients have been well studied, the risks of PICC infections have yet to be fully elucidated. A retrospective chart review was performed of all burn patients with a PICC admitted to our regional burn center from 2006 to 2008. Information collected included: age, total body surface area (TBSA) burn injury, length of hospital stay, duration of PICC line insertion, hospital day of PICC line insertion, and development of infections. All mean values are presented as the mean ± standard error. A total of 56 patients received a PICC during this time period. Eight patients developed PICC infections with an overall rate of 11.7/1000 catheter days. Burn patient CLABSI for the same time period was 12.9/1000 catheter days. Duration of PICC did not differ between infected and noninfected patients (13.3 ± 6 vs. 12.1 ± 9.6 days). Patients with PICC infections had a higher percentage of TBSA (42.7 ± 3.2 vs. 20.6 ± 2.4*), longer length of admission (72.4 ± 6 vs. 35 ± 3.2*), and later hospital day of PICC insertion (48 ± 4.6 vs. 17.1 ± 2.5*). On linear regression analysis, PICC infection was significantly associated with TBSA (B = 22.1*), length of admission (B = 37.4*), and hospital day of PICC insertion (B = 30.3*). On multivariate analysis, TBSA (Odds ratio [OR] = 1.05*), length of admission (OR = 1.04*), and hospital day of PICC insertion (OR = 1.05*) all independently increased the risk of developing a PICC infection. Patients with severe burn injury, long hospital admissions, and later hospital day of PICC insertions are at higher risk of developing PICC infections. This data suggests that protocols should be developed about routine PICC changes in this high-risk burn population. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Adult' 'Bacteremia/*etiology' 'Burns/*therapy'

33361343,2021,Comparing peripherally inserted central catheter-related practices across hospitals with different insertion models: a multisite qualitative study. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) provide reliable intravenous access for delivery of parenteral therapy. Yet, little is known about PICC care practices or how they vary across hospitals. We compared PICC-related processes across hospitals with different insertion delivery models. METHODS: We used a descriptive qualitative methodology and a naturalist philosophy, with site visits to conduct semistructured interviews completed between August 2018 and January 2019. Study sites included five Veterans Affairs Medical Centres, two with vascular access teams (VATs), two with PICC insertion primarily by interventional radiology (IR) and one without on-site PICC insertion capability. Interview participants were healthcare personnel (n=56), including physicians, bedside and vascular access nurses, and IR clinicians. Data collection focused on four PICC domains: use and decision-making process, insertion, in-hospital management and patient discharge education. We used rapid analysis and a summary matrix to compare practices across sites within each domain. RESULTS: Our findings highlight the benefits of dedicated VATs across all PICC-related process domains, including implementation of criteria to guide PICC placement decisions, timely PICC insertion, more robust management practices and well-defined patient discharge education. We also found areas with potential for improvement, such as clinician awareness of PICC appropriateness criteria and alternative devices, deployment of VATs and patient discharge education. CONCLUSION: Vascular access nurses play critical roles in all aspects of PICC-related care. There is variation in PICC decision-making, care and maintenance, and patient education across hospitals. Quality and safety improvement opportunities to reduce this variation are highlighted.

34511570,2022,Risk Factors for Complications Associated with Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters During Induction Chemotherapy for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. ,"Objective Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are widely used in patients with hematologic malignancies. However, the risks of PICC-related complications during chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are not fully understood. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of 128 adult patients with AML who received induction therapy by way of PICC insertion between 2012 and 2019. Results The median duration of PICC insertion was 30 days. The incidence rate of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) was 2.4% at 30 days, and women were more likely to suffer from CRBSI than men. Local reactions at the insertion site were observed in 56 patients; however, these events did not predict CRBSI. The incidence rates of catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) were 1.6% at 30 days. Obesity put patients at an increased risk for CRT. Unexpected PICC removal occurred in 59 patients, and women were at a higher risk of catheter removal than men. Conclusion Low PICC-related complication rates, possibly associated with high rates of catheter removal, were observed during intensive chemotherapy for AML. Women and obese patients require careful monitoring of their PICC. Procedures to achieve appropriate PICC removal without increasing the complication rate need to be considered.

33249623,2021,Incidence and risk factors of symptomatic thrombosis related to peripherally inserted central catheter in patients with lung cancer. ,"AIMS: To determine the incidence and risk factors associated with peripherally inserted central catheter-related thrombosis (PICC-RT) in patients with lung cancer. DESIGN: A retrospective cross-sectional design. METHODS: Patients with lung cancer receiving PICC insertion during 1 March 2014-31 May 2019 at a tertiary hospital in Shanghai, China were enrolled (N = 748). Symptomatic PICC-RT was confirmed by Doppler ultrasonography in the presence of clinical symptoms and signs. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors of symptomatic PICC-RT. RESULTS: Among the patients (mean age, 60.7 years; males, 67.1%), 55 (7.35%) had symptomatic PICC-RT. Based on the multivariate analysis, history of smoking [OR 2.49 (1.13-5.46), p < .05], use of Carboplatin [OR 2.23 (1.19-4.17), p < .05] or Docetaxel [OR 7.23 (1.65-31.56), p < .05], PICC size [OR 3.52 (1.78-6.99), p < .001], and level of D-dimer [OR 5.32 (2.39-11.83), p < .001] were significant risk factors of PICC-RT. CONCLUSION: Several modifiable factors (e.g., PICC size and level of D-dimer) were related to PICC-RT. In the future, prospective studies are warranted to examine whether those factors could increase the risk of PICC-RT. Meanwhile, healthcare professionals are recommended to perform a comprehensive assessment of the patients receiving PICC insertion. Close attention should be paid to those at risk for PICC-RT. IMPACT: Identification of risk factors associated with PICC-RT is an important step towards individualizing the care plan for patients receiving PICC. Our findings provided evidence for the management of PICC-RT in patients with lung cancer. In clinical practice, nurses could deliver appropriate interventions against modifiable risk factors to reduce the risk of PICC-RT.

33438482,2022,Comparing catheter related bloodstream infection rate between cuffed tunnelled and non-cuffed tunnelled peripherally inserted central catheter. ,"OBJECTIVE: To compare catheter related blood stream infection (CRBSI) rate between cuffed tunnelled and non-cuffed tunnelled PICC. METHODS: We prospectively followed 100 patients (50:50 cuffed and non-cuffed PICC) and compared CRBSI rate between these groups. Daily review and similar catheter care were performed until a PICC-related complication, completion of therapy, death or defined end-of-study date necessitate removal. CRBSI was confirmed in each case by demonstrating concordance between isolates colonizing the PICC at the time of infection and from peripheral blood cultures. RESULTS: A total of 50 cuffed PICC were placed for 1864 catheter-days. Of these, 12 patients (24%) developed infection, for which 5 patients (10%) had a CRBSI for a rate of 2.7 per 1000 catheter-days. Another 50 tunnelled non-cuffed PICCs were placed for 2057 catheter-days. Of these, 7 patients (14%) developed infection, for which 3 patients (6%) had a CRBSI. for a rate of 1.5 per 1000 catheter-days. The mean time to development of infection is 24 days in cuffed and 19 days in non-cuffed groups. The mean duration of utilization was significantly longer in non-cuffed than in cuffed group (43 days in non-cuffed vs 37 days in cuffed group, p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Cuffed PICC does not further reduce the rate of local or bloodstream infection. Tunnelled non-cuffed PICC is shown to be as effective if not better at reducing risk of CRBSI and providing longer catheter dwell time compared to cuffed PICC.

35858479,2022,Pharmaceutical Analysis of Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter Requests Increases the Use of Single-Lumen Catheters: A Prospective Pilot Study. ,"OBJECTIVES: Several studies have suggested a strong relationship between the number of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lumens and the risk of complications. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of the intervention of a clinical pharmacist (CP) on the number of lumens of PICC inserted and assess PICC-related complications. METHOD: This prospective monocentric study included all consecutive patients from 5 different units who underwent PICC insertions from September 2017 to March 2018. In the intervention group, the CP validated the pertinence of each PICC request according to the patients' records, choice of device (single or double lumen), and incompatibilities between treatments. The control group consisted of patients who underwent PICC insertions without a CP intervention. Complications were prospectively recorded up to PICC removal. Multivariate analyses adjusted for sex, age, and PICC line duration were performed. RESULTS: In the intervention group, 207 PICCs were inserted, 81.2% (n = 168) were single-lumen devices and 18.8% (n = 39) were double-lumen devices. In the control group (n = 77), the use of single-lumen PICCs was significantly lower (n = 48, 62.3%; P = 0.002). After intervention, the overall complication incidence rate decreased from 4.42 to 3.23 per 1000 catheter days ( P = 0.082). Considering the overall population, 216 single-lumen PICCs were inserted with significantly fewer complications than double-lumens (respectively n = 16, 16/216 = 7.4%, versus n = 15, 15/68 = 22.1%, P = 0.002). The adjusted odds ratio of double-lumen PICC was 3.83 (95% confidence interval, 1.46-10.07; P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed the intervention of a CP in the PICC insertion process could increase the use of single-lumen PICCs and tended to reduce associated complications.

31900609,2020,Peripherally inserted central catheters in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. ,"BACKGROUND: Central venous catheters (CVC) are essential for the management of patients with hematologic malignancies, facilitating chemotherapy infusion, antibiotics, parenteral nutrition, blood products, and blood samples collection. In this population, peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) seem to be associated with lower complications, compared with conventional percutaneously inserted devices (CICC). Data on the PICC in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell recipients (allo-HSCT) are limited. METHODS: We have prospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy of 100 polyurethanes or silicone PICC, inserted into 100 adult allo-HSCT recipients, at the Hematology of Sapienza University of Rome (Italy), between October 2012 and August 2017. RESULTS: The median duration of PICC placement was 117 days. Overall, 68% of patients maintained the device for the entire transplant procedure and PICC were removed after day 100 from allo-HSCT; of these, 44% did not experienced any PICC-related complications. Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) occurred in 32% of patients (2.5/1000 PICC days), associated with thrombosis in 8 cases. CRBSI were observed in 42% of patients with polyurethane and 20% with silicone PICC (p = 0.02). Catheter-related thrombosis occurred in 9% of patients, never requiring anticipated PICC removal. Mechanical complications occurred in 15% of cases (1.2/1000 PICC days). On the whole, adverse events were manageable and did not affect transplant outcome. No deaths related to PICC-complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: PICC are a safe and reliable long-term venous access in allo-HSCT recipients.

33633889,2021,Correlation of Positive Blood Cultures with Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter Line Infection in Oncology Patients. ,"INTRODUCTION: The use of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines offers several advantages compared to traditional central venous catheters (CVCs) as the insertion procedure is minimally invasive, they may be retained safely for longer periods of time, and their use is associated with fewer catheter-related infections. Their use in patients suffering from a malignant disease is common but may pose a greater risk of complications due to the severe immunosuppression associated with treatment. This study was conducted to evaluate the safety of PICC lines in this group. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of oncology patients being treated in a Mediterranean tertiary center. Patients with PICC lines were enrolled in the study if a positive blood culture necessitated the removal of the PICC and subsequent culture of the PICC tip. A comparison was conducted between patients with positive and negative PICC cultures. RESULTS: Thirty patients were included, four of whom had a positive PICC culture. The most commonly isolated pathogens were coagulase-negative Staphylococci and Corynebacteria. No statistically significant difference was noted in white blood cell (WBC) counts, C-reactive protein (CRP), and Michigan PICC central line associated bloodstream infection (MPC) score between the two groups. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most commonly isolated pathogen. DISCUSSION: Though limited by a small sample size and the retrospective design, the findings of this study seem to corroborate existing literature on the subject which suggests that the use of PICC lines in oncology patients is feasible and does not pose unacceptable risk. Further research is indicated to determine subgroups which may be at greater risk of PICC related infections.

34794291,2021,A Comparison of Lower Limb Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter and Deep Venous Catheterisation. ,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical application effects of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) and deep venous catheters placed through the lower limbs in adults with malignancy obviating the use of upper limb PICC. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Oncology, Beijing Shijingshan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China between February 2017 and February 2019. METHODOLOGY: The patients enrolled in this study were assigned to PICC under ultrasound guidance group and deep venous catheterisation group. The inclusion criteria were patients with advanced malignant tumor after bilateral breast cancer lymphadenectomy or superior vena cava obstruction syndrome; bedridden patients; and patients without mental disorders; who could understand the content of this study and agreed to participate in this study. Patients with high-risk thrombosis and venous thrombosis of lower limbs were excluded. The success rate of one-time catheterisation, the length of catheterisation puncture time, the number of catheterisations, and the occurrence of catheter-related complications of the two groups were compared. RESULTS: Ultrasound-guided PICC through the lower limbs had a higher success rate than deep venous catheterization (84.6% vs. 42.9%, p=0.046). The average length of puncture time in adults with PICC through the lower limbs under ultrasound guidance was shorter than that in the femoral vein group (24.69 ± 4.35 vs. 29.14 ± 6.02, p=0.038). No catheter-related infection was found in the two groups of patients. CONCLUSION: The indications for PICC through the lower limbs in adults include patients with advanced malignant tumor after bilateral breast cancer lymphadenectomy or superior vena cava obstruction syndrome, and mainly bedridden patients. This technique has certain advantages over deep venous catheterisation and is an effective choice for venous access.

30683751,2019,Patient-reported complications related to peripherally inserted central catheters: a multicentre prospective cohort study. ,"OBJECTIVE: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) are frequently used to deliver medical therapies, but our knowledge regarding PICC-related complications remains incomplete. The objective of this study was to systematically elicit and characterise PICC-related complications as experienced by patients during and after hospitalisation. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Inpatient medical units at four US hospitals in two states. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive sample of patients who had a new PICC placed during a hospital stay between August 2015 and May 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES: Patient-reported signs and symptoms of a possible PICC-related complication or functional issues. RESULTS: Of the 438 patients in the analytic cohort (91.4% of those consented), two-thirds were male with a mean age of 56 years. The most common reason for PICC placement was long-term antibiotic therapy (43.4%). During the 70-day follow-up period, 61.4% of patients reported signs of at least one complication, including potentially serious complications, such as bloodstream infection (17.6%) and deep vein thrombosis (30.6%). Correspondence of these reported events with medical record documentation of the complication was generally low. More than one-quarter (27.9%) of patients reported minor complications, such as insertion site redness, discomfort or difficult removal. While the PICC was in place, 26.0% reported restrictions in activities of daily living, 14.4% social activity restrictions and 19.2% had difficulty with flushing or operating the PICC. CONCLUSION: Over 60% of patients report signs or symptoms of a possible complication or adverse effect after PICC placement. Bothersome complications from the patient perspective are clearly more common than those that typically rise to the level of healthcare provider attention or concern. Understanding the patient experience is critical for providing safe and effective care. ",['eng'],"['Journal Article' 'Multicenter Study' 'Observational Study'

37333869,2023,"Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters-associated blood stream infections-occurrence, risk factors, and pathogens, a single center study. ","BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are central venous catheters inserted peripherally but terminate in great vessels. PICCs are widely used for patients requiring long-term intravenous therapy in both in-patient and out-patient settings. AIM: This study was carried out to understand PICC-related complications, specifically infections and causal pathogens, in a tertiary care hospital in Kerala, South India. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of PICC insertions and follow-up during a 9 years period to look at patient demographics and infections related to PICC was carried out. RESULTS: The overall PICC-related complication rate is 28.1% (4.98 per 1000 PICC days). Commonest complication was thrombosis followed by infection, either PICC-associated bloodstream infection (PABSI) or local infection (LI). PABSI noted in this study was 1.34 per 1000 catheter days. The majority (85%) of PABSI were due to Gram-negative rods. The average duration of PICC days for occurrence of PABSI was 14 days and the majority occurred in in-patients. CONCLUSION: Thrombosis and infection were the commonest PICC-related complications. PABSI rate was comparable to that of previous studies.

26207019,2017,Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter-Related Vein Thrombosis in Patients With Lung Cancer. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) are widely used in patients with cancer. Catheter usage is one of the risk factors for venous thromboembolism. We aimed to scrutinize the incidence and risk factors for PICC-related upper extremity venous thrombosis (UEVT) in patients with lung cancer receiving chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with lung cancer with PICC insertion undergoing chemotherapy. Symptomatic PICC-UEVT was diagnosed by ultrasound. The relationship between chemotherapeutic agent exposure and PICC-UEVT was evaluated. Patient-, catheter-, and insertion-related factors were analyzed in univariable and multivariable logistic regression to identify significant independent risk factors for PICC-UEVT in patients with lung cancer. RESULTS: A total of 328 patients with lung cancer having PICC undergoing chemotherapy were included, for a total of 34 895 catheter days. Seventeen (5.2%) patients developed PICC-related UEVT, with an incidence of 0.49 per 1000 catheter days. In multivariable logistic analysis, advanced disease was shown to be a significant risk factor for PICC-UEVT (odds ratio [OR]: 4.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4-16.7; P = .011). Patients treated with etoposide had a higher risk of PICC-related UEVT (OR: 3.6; 95% CI: 1.1-12.1; P = .042). Patients were followed up after PICC removal for a median duration of 246 days.

33499716,2022,Technical success and safety of peripherally inserted central catheters in the great saphenous and anterior accessory great saphenous veins. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) are occasionally placed in the great saphenous vein (GSV) and anterior accessory great saphenous vein (AAGSV) in patients with inadequate upper extremity veins or contraindications to upper extremity placement. Outcomes on the placement of PICCs in these veins are limited. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine technical success and safety of GSV/AAGSV PICCs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study that reviewed all GSV/AAGSV PICC placements between January 2011 and December 2019. A total of 29 PICC placements procedures were identified. The electronic medical record was queried for demographic, procedural, and complication data. Technical success was defined by whether the vein could be accessed and a PICC could be placed. Catheter-associated infections, dislodgement or migration, malfunction, and PICC-associated thrombosis were recorded. RESULTS: Technical success of placement was 100%. Twenty-one (72%) catheters were placed in the GSV in the mid to upper thigh and eight (28%) were placed in the AAGSV. The median PICC dwell time was 13 days with a range of 3-155 days. PICC-associated complications occurred after 11 (37.9%) placements. Line associated infection was the most common complication (17.2%). CONCLUSION: Due to a high complication rate, GSV/AAGSV PICC placement should be considered only when upper extremity or cervical PICC placement is not feasible or contraindicated.

A total of 240 patients with PICC were included. Their postinsertion status and influencing factors were investigated using the general information questionnaire, Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK), Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire, Numerical Rating Scale, and Self-rating Anxiety Scale. The mean TSK score was 36.49 ± 4.19 points, and 89 patients (37.08%) had kinesiophobia. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that factors such as education level, age, monthly income level, catheterization history, face, pain level, anxiety, and number of needle insertions influenced postoperative kinesiophobia in patients with PICC (P < .05). The total variation in the TSK score was 71.8%. The incidence of kinesiophobia was relatively high after PICC insertion.

However, it remains unclear whether ABO blood groups are associated with PICC-associated VTE risk. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of related studies to elucidate the potential role of ABO blood group as a risk factor for PICC-associated VTE. METHODS: All detectable case-control and cohort studies comparing the role of ABO blood group as a risk factor for PICC-associated VTE were collected for this analysis by searching PubMed, Embase, CNKI, Web of Science, and Wanfang. We conducted a meta-analysis of the eligible studies and computed the summary risk estimates with random or fixed effects models. RESULTS: A total of four studies involving 7,804 patients were included. Meta-analysis of the studies showed that the risk of PICC-associated VTE was significantly higher in blood types A [odds ratio (OR)=1.54, 95% CI=1.17-2.03), p=0.002], B (OR=2.35, 95% CI=1.71-3.23, p<0.0001), and AB (OR=2.55, 95% CI=1.68-3.88, p<0.0001) and lower in blood types O (OR=0.58, 95% CI=0.45-0.74, p<0.0001). Subgroup analysis based on ethnicity demonstrated that blood type O may be a genetic protective factor for PICC-associated VTE in Asians. Among Caucasians, individuals with blood types B and AB have a higher risk of PICC-associated VTE. Blood types A, B, and AB are risk factors for PICC-associated VTE in Asians. CONCLUSIONS: Blood type O is associated with a decreased risk of PICC-associated VTE, especially in Asian populations. Moreover, blood types A, B, and AB are risk factors for PICC-associated VTE.

35958406,2022,The incidence and risk of venous thromboembolism associated with peripherally inserted central venous catheters in hospitalized patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis. ,"BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) can be fatal if not treated promptly, and individual studies have reported wide variability in rates of VTE associated with peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC). We thus conducted this meta-analysis to investigate the overall incidence and risk of developing PICC-related VTE in hospitalized patients. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from inception until January 26, 2022. In studies with a non-comparison arm, the pooled incidence of PICC-related VTE was calculated. The pooled odds ratio (OR) was calculated to assess the risk of VTE in the studies that compared PICC to the central venous catheter (CVC). The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess methodological quality. RESULTS: A total of 75 articles (58 without a comparison arm and 17 with), including 109292 patients, were included in the meta-analysis. The overall pooled incidence of symptomatic VTE was 3.7% (95% CI: 3.1-4.4) in non-comparative studies. In the subgroup meta-analysis, the incidence of VTE was highest in patients who were in a critical care setting (10.6%; 95% CI: 5.0-17.7). Meta-analysis of comparative studies revealed that PICC was associated with a statistically significant increase in the odds of VTE events compared with CVC (OR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.83-3.37; P < 0.01). However, in subgroup analysis stratified by the study design, there was no significant difference in VTE events between the PICC and CVC in randomized controlled trials (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 0.77-6.74; P = 0.13). CONCLUSION: Best practice standards such as PICC tip verification and VTE prophylaxis can help reduce the incidence and risk of PICC-related VTE. The risk-benefit of inserting PICC should be carefully weighed, especially in critically ill patients. Cautious interpretation of our results is important owing to substantial heterogeneity among the studies included in this study.

METHODS: This was a prospective randomized, controlled trial conducted in single center. All patients 18-90 years old requiring PICC insertion were considered for the study. All patients were followed until PICC removal. Ultrasound examination of the arm was performed at PICC removal or at 28 days. There were 332 patients randomly assigned--164 to the nontapered PICC group and 168 to the reverse tapered PICC group. RESULTS: The overall thrombosis rate was 71.9%. The thrombosis rate was 70.4% in the nontapered PICC group and 73.4% in the reverse tapered PICC group (P = .58). The symptomatic thrombosis rate was 4.3% in the nontapered PICC group and 3.6% in the reverse tapered PICC group (P = .75). The complete thrombosis rate was 15.6% in the nontapered PICC group compared with 20.8% in the reverse tapered PICC group (P = .44). There was a statistically significantly higher thrombosis rate in patients with cancer (71.9% vs 66.7%, P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a high incidence of thrombosis of peripheral veins used for PICC insertion. The implication of this thrombosis is significant in light of the morbidity and potential mortality associated with this condition. A difference in thrombosis rate between devices could not be detected in this study. ",['eng'],"['Comparative Study' 'Journal Article' 'Randomized Controlled Trial'

METHODS: Two hundred patients were randomly assigned to groups based on PICC tunnel length. Data collected included baseline characteristics, catheter-related characteristics, PICC-related complications, and patients' pain and comfort levels. FINDINGS: Patients with 4 cm, 5 cm, and 6 cm PICC tunnel lengths had a longer catheter dwell time and fewer PICC-related complications. No significant differences were found among all groups regarding patients' pain and comfort levels. The results suggest that a tunneled PICC is safe and effective.

38072566,2023,Preventive effect of aspirin on peripherally inserted central catheter-related vein thrombosis in patients with malignant tumors. ,"The majority of patients receiving chemotherapy undergo PICC catheterization. However, PICCs are significantly associated with catheter related complications, including deep vein thrombosis, blood infection, fibrin sheath, catheter prolapse, catheter displacement and blockage. Of all the risks, PICC-related VT was the most prevailing clinic symptom and resulted in a high risk of death. AIM: The study aimed to investigate the preventive efficacy and safety of aspirin for patients with malignant tumors receiving venous thrombosis (VT) related with peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted. Participants with malignant tumors receiving chemotherapy who accepted PICC insertion operation were randomly allocated to the aspirin treatment group (n = 235) or the control group (n = 246). The patients in the aspirin group were administrated aspirin (100mg) for 30 days, whereas the patients in control group were administrated a placebo drug. The incidence of PICC-related VT in both groups and the aspirin related adverse effects were evaluated. RESULTS: The incidence of PICC-related VT was 0.4% in the aspirin group, compared with 3.3% in the control group (P = 0.038). In addition, aspirin related bleeding was not observed. CONCLUSION: PICC-related VT could be effectively prevented by aspirin in patients with malignant tumors. ",['eng'],"['Journal Article' 'Randomized Controlled Trial'

35853499,2022,Effectiveness and cost-efficacy of diuretics home administration via peripherally inserted central venous catheter in patients with end-stage heart failure. ,"BACKGROUND: End-stage heart failure (ESHF) is characterized by severe cardiac dysfunction with persistent disabling symptoms and recurrent acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), despite guideline-directed medical therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous diuretics administration at home through a peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) in ESHF patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-one ESHF patients received PICC implantation for intravenous diuretic administration at home. The primary efficacy endpoint was the patient-level number of HF hospitalizations in the short (1-3 months), medium (six months), and long term (1 year), before and after PICC implantation. Pre- and post-PICC ADHF-free days were also evaluated as co-primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints comprised changes in clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic parameters, and device safety. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to estimate the economic impact of using PICC. For each time frame analyzed, a significant reduction in the number of hospitalizations due to ADHF was observed, resulting in a significant increase in ADHF-free days (71 ± 44 vs. 163 ± 136, p = 0.003). In matched patients' analysis, significant decrease in body weight (68 ± 16 kg vs. 63 ± 10 kg, p = 0.041) and mitral regurgitation grade 3/4 (55% vs. 18%, p < 0.001) were also observed. Freedom from PICC-related complications was observed in 61% of patients. A significant reduction in overall ADHF-hospitalizations cost was observed. CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the effectiveness and safety of home administration of intravenous diuretic therapy via PICC in ESHF patients. This palliative cost-effective strategy can be taken in consideration for selected end-stage patients no longer responsive to conventional therapies.

34373674,2021,What Are the Risk Factors for an Upper Extremity Deep Venous Thrombosis After Orthopaedic Irrigation and Debridement and Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter Placement? ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placement is necessary for delivery of intravenous (IV) antibiotics to treat bone and soft tissue infections. Upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) after PICC placement is a complication with unknown incidence in the orthopaedic literature. The major objectives of this study are Identifying the rate of upper extremity PICC-associated DVTs after orthopaedic procedures;Which orthopaedic subspecialties are most likely to encounter an upper extremity PICC-associated DVT?What surgeries or medical comorbidities are risk factors for upper extremity PICC-associated DVTs?Does type of DVT chemoprophylaxis decrease the risk of an upper extremity PICC-associated DVT? METHODS: A retrospective review of electronic medical records (EMR) was performed to include all patients undergoing irrigation and debridement (I&D) for treatment of orthopaedic surgery-related infections over a 10-year period. All patients with PICC placement were included for analyses. Age, sex, and medical comorbidities were extracted from the EMR. Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests, Fisher's exact tests, Chi-square tests, and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) tests were used to determine associations with DVT events for those with PICCs based on medical comorbidities, PICC lumen size, team placing the PICC, impact of implant removal, and protective effect of DVT chemoprophylaxis. Significance was set at p<0.05. RESULTS: Twenty-one of 660 patients (3.18% rate) were found to have an upper extremity PICC-associated DVT. A history of DVT (OR=8.99 [95% CI: 3.39, 49.42]) was significantly associated with an upper extremity PICC-associated DVT. The greatest risk for an upper extremity PICC-associated DVT was intramedullary implant removal (OR=12.43 [95% CI: 3.13, 49.52]). The type of DVT chemoprophylaxis did not significantly affect the likelihood of an upper extremity PICC-associated DVT. CONCLUSION: Intramedullary implant removal and a history of DVT are risk factors for an upper extremity PICC-associated DVT. The results of this study should be of particular interest to surgeons who do not typically give DVT prophylaxis and plan to perform surgery on patients with CHF, a history of a DVT, or plan to manipulate the intramedullary canal.

29615373,2018,Interventional management of central vein occlusion in patients with peripherally inserted central catheter placement. ,"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the incidence of central vein occlusion (CVO) and analyzed the interventional management for CVO during peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placement to suggest an adequate management protocol to ensure the success and patency of PICCs. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 2568 PICCs to identify CVO in two medical centers between January 2016 and June 2017. Procedural images were reviewed for the following items: date and indication for the PICC; type of catheter; accessed vein and arm; characteristics of CVO on ascending arm venography; PICC placement technique; indwelling period of the PICC; and follow-up records. A guidewire passage trial was performed to the CVO, as follows: a trial with a 0.018-inch single or double guidewire through the pretrimmed PICC lumen; and a trial with a combination of a 0.035-inch guidewire and a curved 5F diagnostic catheter through the PICC introducer sheath. RESULTS: The incidence of CVO was 3.2% (71/2232), and 59 patients were analyzed (23 men; mean age, 69 ± 11 years; median age, 80 years; age range, 31-92 years). Forty-four patients had thrombotic CVO, and 12 patients had acute thrombotic CVO. Thirty-six patients had occlusion of the left innominate vein, and six patients had contiguous involvement of the adjacent central vein. Forty-two patients had obtuse stump morphology of CVO, and 28 patients had grade >III collateral development. The PICC indwelling time was statistically different between the group with successful catheter advancement (n = 36, success group) and the group with failed catheter advancement (n = 18, failure group; P = .007) with ipsilateral trimmed PICCs. Eight patients had a symptomatic catheter associated with upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (UEDVT; <30 days), one in the success group and seven in the failure group. The incidence of catheter-associated UEDVT after primary PICC placement on each arm was statistically different between the success and failure groups (P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: A PICC passage trial for ipsilateral CVO is challenging but frequently successful with a simple guidewire technique, which can preserve catheter patency, decrease contralateral arm access, and prevent the development of new catheter-associated UEDVT.

29683035,2018,Is Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter-Related Thrombosis Associated With ABO Blood Group? A Case-Control Pilot Study. ,"Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) use is associated with many complications including line-related thrombosis. Several studies and meta-analyses confirmed the increased risk to develop venous thromboembolism in non-O blood group individuals. Our pilot study aimed to examine whether PICC-related thrombosis is influenced by ABO blood group. We identified patients admitted to Hurley Medical Center between March 2012 and March 2016 who had PICC placed during their admission, had their ABO blood group identified in their medical record, and had upper extremity venous Doppler ultrasound performed on the same side of PICC. We excluded pregnant women, patients on anticoagulation initiated before PICC insertion, and patients with active cancer. Data of 227 patients who met our criteria were analyzed. Of these patients, 140 (61.7%) patients had PICC-related thrombosis (cases) and 86 (37.9%) patients had O blood group. Controls were patients who had PICC and did not develop PICC-related thrombosis. Multivariate logistic regression revealed no association between PICC-related thrombosis and ABO blood group (adjusted odds ratio: 1.1; 95% confidence interval: 0.6-2.0; P = .733). Therefore, our data suggest that non-O blood group does not increase the odds of having PICC-related thrombosis.

26349890,2016,Peripherally inserted central catheter-related vein thrombosis in breast cancer patients. ,"PURPOSE: To identify clinical incidence, risk factors and treatment of peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs)-related upper extremity venous thrombosis (UEVT) in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of breast cancer patients with PICC insertion undergoing chemotherapy. PICC-related UEVT was diagnosed by ultrasound. Patient-, catheter- and insertion-related factors were analyzed in univariable and multivariable logistic regression to identify significant independent risk factors for PICC-related UEVT. The incidence and treatment of PICC-related UEVT were also analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 568 breast cancer patients with PICC undergoing chemotherapy were included, for a total of 54,769 catheter days; 8 patients (1.4%) developed PICC-related UEVT. The median time of developing UEVT was 11 days (range of 3 to 79 days). In multivariable analysis, metastasis (p = 0.002) and malposition (p = 0.013) were shown to be significant risk factors for PICC-related UEVT. All patients were treated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and followed until PICCs were removed. None of the patients developed pulmonary embolus. CONCLUSIONS: Metastasis and malposition were significant risk factors for PICC-related UEVT in breast cancer patients. With early diagnosis and standardized anticoagulant treatment, a better clinical outcome could be achieved. Further prospective and large sample studies are needed.

35992567,2022,Analysis of Peripapillary Intrachoroidal Cavitation and Myopic Peripapillary Distortions in Polar Regions by Optical Coherence Tomography. ,"PURPOSE: To compare the peripapillary polar characteristics in eyes combining peripapillary staphyloma and gamma peripapillary atrophy according to whether peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation (PICC) was present or absent (combination-group). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective non-interventional cross-sectional study included 667 eyes of 334 subjects. From the polar peripapillary regions to the opening of Bruch's membrane, the following elements and their topographic relationships were analyzed using optical coherence tomography sections: configuration of the posterior curvature of the choroid, visibility of the subarachnoid space (SAS), and suprachoroidal detachment (SCD). Chi-squared and Fisher exact tests were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The protrusion of the posterior choroidal wall, with anterior elevation on either side, observed in both groups progressed and transformed into a wedge-shaped deformity on the side of gamma peripapillary atrophy. This wedge configuration was significantly more frequent in PICC-group than in combination-group (p = 0.004 and p < 0.001) for the upper and lower poles, respectively. SAS was more frequently observed in PICC-group than in combination-group (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001) for the upper and lower poles, respectively. SCD was detected exclusively in PICC-group (p < 0.001, both poles). The wedge-shaped configuration and the SCD were aligned antero-posteriorly with the SAS. CONCLUSION: We confirmed that PICC is an SCD. We observed its constant alignment with the SAS. We suggest that the tensile forces of the optic nerve sheaths during adduction promote the collapse of the scleral flange onto the SAS, leading to PICC. Further studies are warranted to confirm this hypothesis. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],[],"['gamma peripapillary atrophy' 'myopic complications'

33409725,2021,Hindrances of peripherally inserted central catheter care of leukemia patients: a qualitative study. ,"OBJECTIVE: A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) needs regular care. However, clinical observations found that some discharged leukemia patients in mainland China had not complied with the requirement of regular care. Our study aims to explore the facilitators and hindrances of regular cares of PICC in leukemia patients with the Colaizzi phenomenon analysis. METHODS: This qualitative report used the descriptive phenomenological method to collect information and was conducted in accordance with the COREQ checklist. By purposive sampling, 11 leukemia patients with PICC were selected and interviewed in the Department of Hematology of a first-class hospital in Wuhan (central China). The interviews were conducted from March 2016 to May 2017. RESULTS: Two facilitators for PICC care were extracted through interviews, including fear of nosocomial infection and convenience for treatment. Eleven hindrances were summarized, including high costs, unavailability of local services, worries about affecting family members, a lack of health awareness, inconvenient transportations, fluke minds, physical discomfort, fears of leukemia and chemotherapy, short chemotherapy intervals, damage to appearance, and no insurance coverage of costs. CONCLUSION: Leukemia patients' compliance with PICC care was hindered by several factors. The improvement of PICC care may need joint efforts of patients, nursing professionals, hospitals' managerial staff, and governments.

28869706,2018,Early use of peripherally inserted central catheters is safe in Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia. ,"BACKGROUND: Management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) includes prolonged intravenous antibiotics often administered through a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC). Optimal timing of PICC insertion for SAB treatment is unknown. There are concerns that early insertion may increase the risk of subsequent line infection. AIMS: This retrospective audit aims to determine if early PICC insertion is safe. The outcomes considered included crude mortality, attributable mortality, PICC line infections, duration of bacteraemia and relapsed SAB. METHODS: Patients with SAB at our institution between March 2013 and September 2016 were identified. Early PICC line insertion was defined as occurring within 48 h of index positive blood culture. RESULTS: This retrospective audit identified 357 patients with SAB who subsequently received a PICC. This study did not show any significant differences between the early and late PICC insertion groups for attributable mortality (6.3% and 4.8%, P = 0.27), duration of bacteraemia (median 2 days for both groups, P = 0.48) and relapsed SAB (4.7% and 4.1%, P = 0.74). Importantly, no confirmed PICC infections were identified in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Early PICC insertion in SAB appears safe in this retrospective audit. If validated in prospective studies, this should allow for the early establishment of safe, reliable intraveous access in SAB patients. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Bacteremia/diagnosis/*therapy'

33383236,2021,The Caprini thrombosis risk model predicts the risk of peripherally inserted central catheter-related upper extremity venous thrombosis in patients with cancer. ,"BACKGROUND: A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) is often necessary for patients receiving chemotherapy, but there is a risk of PICC-related venous thrombosis (VT). We sought to use the Caprini thrombosis risk model and color Doppler flow imaging for the dynamic monitoring of an eventual thrombosis in patients receiving chemotherapy. METHODS: This prospective study was carried out from January 2018 to May 2019 in patients who underwent PICC implantation and maintenance at the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. The outcome event was the occurrence of PICC-related upper extremity venous thrombosis confirmed by color Doppler flow imaging. RESULTS: A total of 201 participants were enrolled, of whom 108 (53.7%) developed VT. Three participants (1.5%) developed symptomatic VT. Univariable logistic regression analysis suggested that the Caprini score (odds ratio [OR], 1.243; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.074-1.438; P = .003), the PICC model (OR, 0.448; 95% CI, 0.223-0.901; P = .024), and a previous history of PICC-related deep vein thrombosis (OR, 9.388; 95% CI, 1.178-74.786; P = .034) were associated with PICC-related upper extremity VT. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that only the Caprini score (OR, 1.188; 95% CI, 1.018-1.386; P = .029) was an independent risk factor for PICC-related venous thrombus. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed the Caprini risk assessment model had a predictive value for upper extremity VT, with an area under the curve of 0.615 (95% CI, 0.538-0.693), 74.1% sensitivity, and 44.1% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The Caprini score is an independent predictor of the development of PICC-related VT in patients with cancer. However, the moderate sensitivity and low specificity of the Caprini risk assessment model may limit its predictive value in the clinical setting.

24612469,2014,Peripherally inserted central catheter-related deep vein thrombosis: contemporary patterns and predictors. ,"BACKGROUND: Despite growing use, peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are associated with risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). We designed a study to determine patient, provider and device factors associated with this outcome. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of adults who underwent PICC placement between 1 June 2009 to 30 June 2012. Symptomatic PICC-associated DVT was confirmed by ultrasound. Because PICCs are also recognized risk factors for lower-extremity DVT, lower-extremity DVT occurring while the PICC was in situ was included. Multivariable logistic and Cox-proportional hazards regression models were fit to examine the association between covariates specified a priori and PICC-DVT. Odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were generated. RESULTS: Of 966 unique PICC placements, 33 patients developed symptomatic PICC-associated DVT and 9 developed lower-extremity DVT, accounting for 42 thrombotic events. On bivariate analysis, recent diagnosis of cancer, interventional radiology placement, chemotherapy administration, number of lumens and PICC-gauge were associated with PICC-DVT. Following multivariable adjustment, recent cancer diagnosis (OR 1.95 [95% CI 1.01-3.76]) and PICC gauge (HR 2.21 [95%CI 1.04-4.70] and HR 3.56 [95%CI 1.31-9.66] for 5-Fr and 6-Fr PICCs, respectively) remained associated with thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Recent diagnosis of cancer and PICC gauge are associated with PICC-DVT. These findings have important clinical ramifications and suggest that placement of large gauge PICCs or PICCs in patients with cancer may provoke thrombosis. Improved policies and procedural oversights in these areas appear necessary to prevent PICC-DVT. ",['eng'],"['Journal Article' ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""

It aimed to expand the scope of PICC applications. METHODS: From March 2016 to August 2017, 101 cases of patient with tumor admitted to the hospital were included in this study. The control study was performed before and after PICC placement. The tip positioning of PICC placement was performed under the guidance of bedside ECG system. The X-ray confirmation was applied for confirmation. Several parameters were observed, including positioning accuracy, success rate of primary catheterization, incidence of ectopic catheter, average catheterization time, and incidence of complications. RESULTS: Position accuracy was 100%. The success rate of primary catheterization was 99%. The incidence of ectopic catheter was 1%. Average catheterization time was (49.59 ± 21.45) min. Incidence of postoperative complications within 1 week was 4%. CONCLUSION: ECG-guided PICC tip positioning was safe and accurate. Success rate of catheterization could be improved.

METHOD: A retrospective analysis was performed for 223 bone tumor patients who received PICC and were admitted to our hospital from 2004 to 2017. A total of 18 cases (infection group) with PICC catheter-related infections and 205 cases without infection (noninfection group) were studied. First, factor analysis of variance or Chi-square test was applied to compare independent risk factors for PICC catheter-related infections, between bone tumor patients with catheter-related infections and those without catheter-related infections. RESULTS: This retrospective analysis involved a total of 18 patients with PICC infections and 205 patients without infections. The infection rate was 8.07%. Factor analysis of variance showed that many factors were related to PICC catheter-related infections, including experience of operator (χ(2) = 3.48, P < 0.05), catheter retention time (χ(2) = 7.478, P < 0.05), receiving chemotherapy or not (χ(2) = 2.43, P < 0.05), Karnofsky Performance Scale scores (χ(2) = 2.19, P < 0.05) and the frequency of replacing pad pasting on the point of puncture (χ(2) = 2.23).

32269677,2020,Preventive application of low molecular weight heparin ameliorates peripherally inserted central catheter-related venous thrombosis. ,"OBJECTIVE: Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) is being increasingly used in critical care settings. However, PICC is associated with various complications, particularly venous thrombosis. Our aim was to observe the effects of preventive application of low molecular weight heparin on venous thrombosis in a PICC model. METHODS: All rabbits were randomly divided into four groups: a control group, and low/medium/high concentration of low molecular weight heparin groups. All rabbits were injected prophylactically with normal saline or low molecular weight heparin once a day for 7 days. A PICC model was constructed. The pathologic changes of ear vein, anterior vena cava, and venous thrombosis were investigated using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Biochemical testing was performed including prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and thrombin time (TT). Serum D-dimer (D2D) and fibrinogen (FG) levels were detected using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: X-ray results showed that the PICC model was successfully constructed. H&E results showed that preventive application of low molecular weight heparin significantly ameliorated the pathologic damage to ear vein and anterior vena cava in the PICC model. Furthermore, we found that preventive application of low molecular weight heparin inhibited venous thrombosis in the model by H&E stain. Moreover, it significantly reduced serum FG and D2D levels in PICC model. Biochemical testing results showed that PT, APTT, and TT were significantly elevated in the PICC model. CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that preventive application of low molecular weight heparin significantly ameliorates venous thrombosis in a PICC model.

The feasibility and safety of PICC for induction chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) remain unclear. Medical records of 89 newly diagnosed adult de novo AML patients, who achieved complete remission, were retrospectively reviewed (PICC group, n = 43; intravenous [IV] line group, n = 46). Patients' clinical characteristics and the number of blind punctures for blood sampling were compared between these two groups, and risk factors associated with bacteraemia were identified by univariate analysis. Patients in the PICC group experienced significantly fewer blind punctures than those in the IV line group (3.3 ± 3.6 vs. 14.4 ± 6.0; p = .000); 20.9% of PICC patients had bacteraemia, compared with 23.9% in the IV line group (p = .803). Most patients (76.7%) removed their PICC because treatment was completed. PICC increased the quality of life in AML patients undergoing chemotherapy induction by reducing the number of blind blood punctures required. Bacteraemia in PICC patients was comparable to that in IV line patients. PICC is, therefore, a feasible and safe central venous device for use in AML patients.

35236188,2023,A six-year study of complications related to peripherally inserted central catheters: A multi-center retrospective cohort study in China. ,"OBJECTIVE: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), the most frequent central venous catheter, are used to provide medical treatments, although long-term PICC-related adverse outcomes are unknown in China. This study systematically investigated PICC-related complications in four Chinese hospitals. METHODS: Between January 2014 and January 2020, we analyzed the results of 3550 patients with PICC who were referred to four Chinese hospitals. All patients underwent PICC treatment in four Chinese hospitals. Patient-reported signs and symptoms of a putative PICC-related complication or functional were studied. Long-term outcomes and hospitalization costs were also evaluated. RESULTS: An aggregate of 3285 patients were enrolled in the analytic cohort. 58.6% were females and 41.4% were males. The most common reasons for PICC placement included oncologic malignancy and critically ill patients. The majority of PICCs had valved systems (90.7%) and were implanted in the right side (85.5%) and into the basilic vein (87.7%). At least one potential PICC-related problem or adverse effects (AEs) was reported by 67.3% of patients. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (28.1%) and symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (20.7%) were the most common complications. The majority of PICCs were removed for causes other than AEs, with just 723 reported AEs accounting for 22.0% of all PICC removals. The most reasons for PICCs removal were occlusion (425, 12.9%) and exit-site infections (189, 5.8%). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first retrospective study in our country to explore PICC-related complications. While living with a PICC, more than 67.3% of patients report signs and symptoms of at least one PICC-related problem or adverse impacts, such as difficulties with PICC use and poor effects on physical and social function. In this group, PICCs are safe and effective, although the danger of PICC-related problems should not be disregarded.

35702086,2022,Effects of high-quality nursing on complications of peripherally inserted central catheter placement in patients with leukemia. ,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of high-quality nursing on negative emotions, treatment compliance, and complications of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placement in patients with leukemia. METHODS: A total of 87 patients with leukemia treated in our hospital from May 2018 to May 2020 were retrospectively enrolled and their clinical data were analyzed. The patients were assigned to a routine group (n=40) and a high-quality group (n=47) based on different nursing schemes. The self-rating depression scale (SDS) and self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) were used to compare the negative emotional changes in patients of the two groups, and the visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to analyze the degree of pain. The two groups were compared in treatment compliance, quality of life, incidence of complications of PICC placement, and nursing satisfaction. RESULTS: After intervention, the high-quality group got significantly lower SDS and SAS scores than the routine group (both P<0.05). Compared with the routine group, the high-quality group showed higher treatment compliance and nursing satisfaction, experienced higher quality of life (all P<0.05), with also a lower total incidence of complications of PICC placement (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: For patients with leukemia, high-quality nursing can substantially improve their psychological state, treatment compliance and nursing satisfaction, and reduce the incidence of complications of PICC placement.

29408616,2018,"Risk of Venous Thromboembolism Following Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter Exchange: An Analysis of 23,000 Hospitalized Patients. ","BACKGROUND: Catheter exchange over a guidewire is frequently performed for malfunctioning peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs). Whether such exchanges are associated with venous thromboembolism is not known. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study to assess the association between PICC exchange and risk of thromboembolism. Adult hospitalized patients that received a PICC during clinical care at one of 51 hospitals participating in the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety consortium were included. The primary outcome was hazard of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (radiographically confirmed upper-extremity deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) in those that underwent PICC exchange vs those that did not. RESULTS: Of 23,010 patients that underwent PICC insertion in the study, 589 patients (2.6%) experienced a PICC exchange. Almost half of all exchanges were performed for catheter dislodgement or occlusion. A total of 480 patients (2.1%) experienced PICC-associated deep vein thrombosis. The incidence of deep vein thrombosis was greater in those that underwent PICC exchange vs those that did not (3.6% vs 2.0%, P < .001). Median time to thrombosis was shorter among those that underwent exchange vs those that did not (5 vs 11 days, P = .02). Following adjustment, PICC exchange was independently associated with twofold greater risk of thrombosis (hazard ratio [HR] 1.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37-2.85) vs no exchange. The effect size of PICC exchange on thrombosis was second in magnitude to device lumens (HR 2.06; 95% CI, 1.59-2.66 and HR 2.31; 95% CI, 1.6-3.33 for double- and triple-lumen devices, respectively). CONCLUSION: Guidewire exchange of PICCs may be associated with increased risk of thrombosis. As some exchanges may be preventable, consideration of risks and benefits of exchanges in clinical practice is needed.

33355838,2021,"Safety, Efficacy, and Patient Satisfaction with Initial Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters Compared with Usual Intravenous Access in Terminally Ill Cancer Patients: A Randomized Phase II Study. ","PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether routine insertion of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) at admission to a hospice-palliative care (HPC) unit is acceptable in terms of safety and efficacy and whether it results in superior patient satisfaction compared to usual intravenous (IV) access. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Terminally ill cancer patients were randomly assigned to two arms: routine PICC access and usual IV access arm. The primary endpoint was IV maintenance success rate, defined as the rate of functional IV maintenance until the intended time (discharge, transfer, or death). RESULTS: A total of 66 terminally ill cancer patients were enrolled and randomized to study arms. Among them, 57 patients (routine PICC, 29; usual IV, 28) were analyzed. In the routine PICC arm, mean time to PICC was 0.84 days (range, 0 to 3 days), 27 patients maintained PICC with function until the intended time. In the usual IV arm, 11 patients maintained peripheral IV access until the intended time, and 15 patients underwent PICC insertion. The IV maintenance success rate in the routine PICC arm (27/29, 93.1%) was similar to that in the usual IV arm (26/28, 92.8%, p=0.958). Patient satisfaction at day 5 was better in the routine PICC arm (97%, 'a little comfort' or 'much comfort') compared with the usual IV arm (21%) (p <0.001). CONCLUSION: Routine PICC insertion in terminally ill cancer patients was comparable in safety and efficacy and resulted in superior satisfaction compared with usual IV access. Thus, routine PICC insertion could be considered at admission to the HPC unit. ",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II' 'Journal Article'

DESIGN: The study had a descriptive, multicentre, cross-sectional design. METHODS: We used a questionnaire to investigate patient experiences (N = 359). RESULTS: Patients experiences were not optimal on each of the items in the questionnaire. Nevertheless, few respondents would have preferred a traditional peripheral venous catheter instead. Moreover, free-text answers indicated that patients were very satisfied with their catheter. Results also indicate that the hospitals have different approach when selecting a PICC line or a Midline as route of choice. The only factor associated with patient experiences was ""complications.""

The effectiveness of synthetic polymer-coated and non-coated PICCs was compared. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced cancers who had indwelling PICCs were reviewed using their medical records. Three types of PICCs were compared in terms of complications and catheter failure. RESULTS: A total of 90 patients were retrospectively analyzed, including 31 with Groshong PICCs, 30 with Argyle PICC kit, and 29 with Argyle PICC kit II. The incidence of catheter failure for Groshong PICC, Argyle PICC kit, and Argyle PICC kit II per 1,000 PICC days was 4.4614, 5.6617, and 0.8658, respectively. Catheter failure-free survival in the Argyle PICC kit II group was significantly better than that in the Argyle PICC kit group (p=0.0339).

","PURPOSE: A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) is associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE) especially in patients suffering from cancer. We analyzed the incidence, risk factors, and patterns of PICC-related VTE in cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with cancer who underwent PICC placement were evaluated retrospectively. Routine, prospective ultrasound post-PICC placement was used for asymptomatic and symptomatic patients to identify VTE. Multivariable logistic regression models with odds ratios (ORs) were used to examine VTE risk factors. RESULTS: Of 2353 PICCs placed, 165 patients (7.01%) developed PICC-related VTE with a median thrombosis time of 12 days. After adjustment of multivariable analysis, patients with PICC-related VTE were more likely to have a ratio of PICC diameter:vein diameter >0.35 (adjusted OR, 1.689; 95% CI, 1.023-2.789) and high level of triglycerides (1.561; 1.096-2.223). The prevalence of A (adjusted OR, 1.680; 95% CI, 1.009-2.798), B (1.835; 1.137-2.961), and AB (3.275; 1.840-5.829) blood group was significantly higher than that of the O blood group in VTE patients. Venous recanalization was observed in 44.8% (74/165) patients after anticoagulation therapy, and more often in patients with combined deep VTE than in patients with isolated superficial VTE (OR, 17.942; 95% CI, 5.427-59.316). The recanalization time was 20±5 (range, 10-31) days. CONCLUSION: The non-O blood group, larger ratio of PICC diameter:vein diameter, and high level of triglycerides were significantly associated with PICC-related VTE.

32152091,2020,Appropriateness of peripherally inserted central catheter use among general medical inpatients: an observational study using routinely collected data. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) are among the most commonly used medical devices in hospital. This study sought to determine the appropriateness of inpatient PICC use in general medicine at five academic hospitals in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, based on the Michigan Appropriateness Guide for Intravenous Catheters (MAGIC). METHODS: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study of general internal medicine patients discharged between 1 April 2010 and 31 March 2015 who received a PICC during hospitalisation. The primary outcomes were the proportions of appropriate and inappropriate inpatient PICC use based on MAGIC recommendations. Hospital administrative data and electronic clinical data were used to determine appropriateness of each PICC placement. Multivariable regression models were fit to explore patient predictors of inappropriate use. RESULTS: Among 3479 PICC placements, 1848 (53%, 95% CI 51% to 55%) were appropriate, 573 (16%, 95% CI 15% to 18%) were inappropriate and 1058 (30%, 95% CI 29% to 32%) were of uncertain appropriateness. The proportion of appropriate and inappropriate PICCs ranged from 44% to 61% (p<0.001) and 13% to 21% (p<0.001) across hospitals, respectively. The most common reasons for inappropriate PICC use were placement in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (n=500, 14%) and use for fewer than 15 days in patients who are critically ill (n=53), which represented 14% of all PICC placements in the intensive care unit. Patients who were older, female, had a Charlson Comorbidity Index score greater than 0 and more severe illness based on the Laboratory-based Acute Physiology Score were more likely to receive an inappropriate PICC. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical practice recommendations can be operationalised into measurable domains to estimate the appropriateness of PICC insertions using routinely collected hospital data. Inappropriate PICC use was common and varied substantially across hospitals in this study, suggesting that there are important opportunities to improve care.

33414259,2021,A new clinical approach to improve the appropriate use of peripherally inserted central catheters: a prospective study. ,"OBJECTIVES: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are central venous catheters commonly used for administration of chemotherapy, prolonged antibiotic treatment, or parenteral nutrition. It is advisable to use the PICC with the fewest lumens and the smallest possible diameter to reduce major complications. A pharmaceutical analysis and validation of PICC requests was designed to improve efficiency and patient safety. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of pharmaceutical interventions (PIs) by the clinical pharmacist in the PICC process. METHODS: A prospective pilot study was conducted in a French university hospital. Four categories of PIs were defined according to the different stages of the PICC insertion process: before insertion to validate with the physician the relevance of the request and the choice of PICC model (PI applicant); during insertion (PI installer); during usage by nurses for analysis of drug incompatibilities (PI user); and at hospital discharge for reassessment of the device maintenance (PI reassessment). Each PI applicant was designated a potential harm from 1 to 4, with a cut-off of 2 representing harm for the patient. RESULTS: Over 6 months, 277 requests were analysed and 297 PIs were completed (109 applicants, 98 installers, 84 users, and 6 PIs for reassessment). The acceptance rate by the physicians was 93.6%. 52% of the PI applicants had a potential harm of 2 or more. 5% of PICC requests were refused by the pharmacist due to an inappropriate choice of device. A total of 207 (74.7%) of the requests analysed by the clinical pharmacist led to insertion. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a clinical pharmacy activity applied to PICC requests analysis and validation leads to improved patient care by securing the PICC circuit. This analysis demonstrates the beneficial role of the clinical pharmacist in PIs associated with medical devices. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['*Catheterization, Central Venous'

29125332,2018,ABO blood group related venous thrombosis risk in patients with peripherally inserted central catheters. ,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between ABO blood group and upper limb venous thrombosis (VT) risk in patients with peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC). METHODS: Single centre retrospective cohort study. A cohort of patients who underwent PICC insertion from September 2010 to August 2014 were followed up for symptomatic VT presentations diagnosed by ultrasound. Blood group status was identified from hospital information systems. RESULTS: 2270 participants had 3020 PICCs inserted. There were 124 cases of symptomatic VT, an incident rate of 4% [95% confidence interval, CI (3-5%)]. Univariate analysis adjusting for the clustered sample showed that having chemotherapy, two or more previous PICCs, a larger catheter size, a diagnosis of cancer and having a blood group B were all associated with an increased risk of a VT. In the multivariate analysis, PICC diameter, cancer diagnosis and blood group B were all independently associated with increased risk of VT. CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing PICC insertion with a blood group B appear to have a higher risk of VT, independent of risks attached to the PICC procedure and cancer diagnosis. Without any existing guidelines for PICC-related VT, this investigation creates a platform for further research to be conducted in order to establish guidelines. Advances in knowledge: Previous studies investigating VT risk associated with blood group status related to large heterogeneous populations. In this article, we look at patients specifically with PICC, which reduces the heterogeneity in the cohort. In addition, due to the substantial number of patients enrolled, we had a chance to perform multivariate analyses with statistical significance.

30773436,2019,Cost-Effectiveness of a Guided Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter Placement System: A Single-Center Cohort Study. ,"PURPOSE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placements using an ultrasound and electrocardiogram-guided system versus external measurements and confirmatory chest X-rays (CXRs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-eight guided PICC placements were performed in 63 outpatients (mean age, 43 ± 13 years; 50% male) and compared to 68 propensity score-matched PICC placements (mean age, 44 ± 13 years; 56% male) performed using external measurements by the same operators. Post-placement CXRs were used to confirm final catheter tip positioning. Cohorts were compared in terms of repositioning rates, desired tip positioning rates (in the lower third of the superior vena cava or at the cavoatrial junction), and estimated cost per PICC positioned as desired using manufacturer quotes, Medicare reimbursement rates, and hourly wages for staff time. Agreement between tip positioning according to the guided system versus CXR was also assessed. RESULTS: Guided PICC placements required less repositioning (1.5% vs 10.3%, P = .03) and resulted in more catheters positioned as desired (86.8% vs 67.6%, P = .01) than the external measurement approach. The cost per PICC positioned as desired was lower for guided placements ($318.54 vs $381.44), suggesting that the guided system was cost-effective in this clinical setting. Guided system-CXR agreement for tip position was poor (κ=0.25, P = .002) due to tips being slightly farther from the cavoatrial junction on CXR than indicated by the guided system. CONCLUSIONS: The guided PICC placement system was cost-effective in outpatients treated by a single division of interventional radiology at an academic institution.

27078849,2016,High risk of deep vein thrombosis associated with peripherally inserted central catheters in lymphoma. ,"Peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) are widely used in cancer patients. Although PICC is a convenient tool, its use is associated with an obvious increase in the incidence of venous thrombosis. The risk factors for deep vein thrombosis associated with the use of PICCs in cancer patients are largely unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the incidence of PICC-associated thrombosis in lymphoma compared with its incidences in other types of cancer. A total of 8028 adult cancer patients inserted with PICC between June 2007 and June 2015 were included in this study. A total of 249 of the 8028 included patients (3.1%) inserted with PICC developed upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (PICC-UEDVT). Patients with lymphoma were more likely to have PICC-UEDVT than those with other types of malignancies (7.1% vs. 2.80%; P < 0.001). Logistic analysis revealed that a lymphoma diagnosis was a risk factor for UEDVT in cancer patients inserted with PICC (OR: 3.849, 95% CI: 2.334-6.347). Patients with lymphoma may be more predisposed to developing PICC-UEDVT than those with other types of malignancies.

METHODS: In total, 549 hospitalized patients aged 66 to 104 years who were undergoing PICC placement from January 2008 to December 2014 were enrolled. Symptomatic venous thrombosis was confirmed by B-mode or Doppler ultrasonography in the presence of clinical signs. Logistic regression analysis was performed on the variables of interest to identify the risk factors for thrombosis. Odds ratios (ORs) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals were generated. RESULTS: Of the 549 patients with PICC placement, 106 (19.3%) developed PICC-associated venous thrombosis, 84 cases of which were symptomatic. The logistic regression results revealed that PICC-related venous thrombosis was associated with a history of venous thrombosis (OR, 6.745 [3.237–14.056]), number of lumens (OR, 1.934 [1.362–2.572] and OR, 3.762 [1.672–5.932] for dual and triple lumens, respectively), and PICC gauge (OR, 1.821 [1.256–2.537] and OR, 3.864 [1.367–8.251] for 5-Fr and 6-Fr, respectively).

34498477,2021,A comparative study on the tip position of peripherally inserted central catheter inserted at two forward P-wave amplitudes by intracavitary electrocardiogram in cancer patients. ,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare the tip location of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) under two forward P-wave amplitudes (P-wave amplitude is the autonomous peak or P-wave amplitude is 50-80% of the QRS main wave) by intracavitary electrocardiogram (IC-EKG) to determine the PICC tip in optimal location thus avoiding catheter-related complications. METHODS: The data of 300 cancer patients with PICC insertion were collected retrospectively. For the observation group, the position of the catheter tip was left at the level when P wave amplitude was its autonomous peak (168 patients catheterized in 2018). While for the control group, the catheter tip was left at the level when the P wave amplitude was 50-80% of the QRS main wave (132 patients catheterized in 2017). Both groups of patients underwent the chest X-ray examination (CXR) after catheterization. The total compliance rate [PICC tip was located in the lower third of the Superior Vena Cava (SVC) and the Cavo-Atrial Junction (CAJ)], the optimal position compliance rate (PICC tip was located in the CAJ), and the incidence of the catheter tip malposition were compared between the two groups. The complications after catheterization including arrhythmia after catheterization within 24 hours, catheter-related thrombosis, catheter dysfunction, and catheter infection within 90 days were also compared. RESULTS: There was no difference in the total compliance rate of PICC tip position and the incidence of the catheter malposition in the two groups (P>0.05). But the optimal position compliance rate of the observation group was higher than that of the control group (P<0.05). There was no difference in the incidence of arrhythmia after catheterization within 24 hours of the two groups (P>0.05). The incidence of catheter-related thrombosis, catheter dysfunction, and catheter infection within 90 days in the observation group was lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The PICC tip position at the autonomous peak of the P wave is significantly better than that at the P wave amplitude being 50-80% of the QRS main wave under the IC-EKG guidance for PICC insertion.

33836784,2021,Peripherally inserted central venous catheter in upper extremities leads to an increase in D-dimer and deep vein thrombosis in lower extremities. ,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to elucidate the association between peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) in upper extremities and lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (LEDVT) by observing the changes in D-dimer. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study with 3452 patients (104 inserted with PICCs and 3348 without PICC) enrolled at the neurology department from April 1, 2017 to April 1, 2020. The patients underwent color Doppler ultrasound (CDU) and D-dimer examinations. LEDVT-related factors and D-dimer value were analyzed before and after PICC insertion. The predictive value of D-dimer for LEDVT was also evaluated. RESULTS: Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that PICC insertion increased the risk of LEDVT by 9 times and promoted the increase of D-dimer by 5 times. After risk adjustment, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that PICC insertion increased the risk of LEDVT by 4 times and tripled the risk of D-dimer increase. The concentration of D-dimer was significantly increased after PICC insertion. D-dimer was unsuitable for excluding venous thrombosis in patients inserted with PICCs. CONCLUSIONS: PICC insertion increases the level of D-dimer and the risk of LEDVT. The risks of venous thrombosis need to be assessed in patients inserted with PICCs to ensure the expected clinical outcomes.

32928286,2020,A comparison of hydrophobic polyurethane and polyurethane peripherally inserted central catheter: results from a feasibility randomized controlled trial. ,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the feasibility of an efficacy trial comparing a hydrophobic polyurethane peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) with a standard polyurethane PICC. METHODS: This pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted between May 2017 and February 2018. Adult participants (n = 111) were assigned to hydrophobic polyurethane PICC with proximal valve (intervention) or a polyurethane PICC with external clamp (standard care). Primary outcome was trial feasibility including PICC failure. Secondary outcomes were central line-associated bloodstream infection, local infection, occlusion, thrombosis, fracture and dislodgement, phlebitis, local or systemic allergic reaction, and PICC dwell time. RESULTS: All feasibility outcomes were achieved, apart from eligibility criteria. In total, 338 patients were screened, 138 were eligible (41%), and of these 111 were randomised (80%). Patients received the allocated PICC in 106 (95%) insertions. No patients withdrew from the study and there was no missing data. PICC failure was 24% (13/55) in the intervention group and 22% (12/55) in the standard care group (p = 0.820). PICC failure per 1000 PICC days was 16.3 in the intervention group and 18.4 in the control group (p = 0.755). The average dwell time was 12 days in the intervention and 8 days in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of an efficacy trial of PICC materials in an adult population, once adjustments were made to include not only in-patients, but also patients being discharged to the Hospital in the Home service.

37341211,2023,The effect of introducing a nurse-practitioner-led peripherally inserted central venous catheter placement program on the utilization of central venous access device: A retrospective study in Japan. ,"BACKGROUND: Nurse-led peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) placement teams are common in western hospitals, but they are still in their infancy in Japan. Although implementing a dedicated program may improve ongoing vascular-access management, the direct hospital-level effects of launching a nurse-led PICC team on specific outcomes have not been formally investigated. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of introducing a nurse practitioner (NP)-led PICC-placement program on subsequent utilization of centrally inserted central catheters (CICCs) and to contrast the quality of PICC placements conducted by physicians and NPs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent central venous access devices (CVADs) between 2014 and 2020 at a university hospital in Japan were evaluated retrospectively using an interrupted time-series analysis on the trend for monthly CVAD utilization and logistic regression and propensity score-based analyses for PICC-related complications. RESULTS: Among 6007 CVAD placements, 2230 PICCs were inserted into 1658 patients (725 by physicians and 1505 by NPs). The monthly number of CICC utilization fell from 58 in April 2014 to 38 in March 2020, while PICC placements by the NP PICC team increased from 0 to 104. The implementation of the NP PICC program reduced the immediate rate (by 35.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 24.1-46.9; p < 0.001) and post-intervention trend (by 2.3; 95% CI: 1.1-3.5; p < 0.001) of monthly CICC utilization. Overall immediate complication rates were lower in the NP group than the physician group (1.5% vs 5.1%; adjusted odds ratio = 0.31; 95% CI: 0.17-0.59; p < 0.001). The cumulative incidences of central line-associated bloodstream infections were comparable between the NP and physician groups (5.9% vs 7.2%; adjusted hazard ratio = 0.96; 95% CI: 0.53-1.75; p = .90). CONCLUSIONS: This NP-led PICC program reduced CICC utilization without affecting the quality of PICC placement or complication rate.

25295962,2014,Quality improvement initiative to reduce deep vein thrombosis associated with peripherally inserted central catheters in adults with cystic fibrosis. ,"RATIONALE: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are common in the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Previous reports suggest that patients with CF are at increased risk for PICC-associated deep vein thrombosis (DVT). OBJECTIVES: We assessed potential risk factors for symptomatic PICC-associated DVT with subsequent implementation of a quality improvement (QI) initiative to reduce PICC-associated DVT in patients with CF. METHODS: This was a 5-year retrospective cohort study with subsequent 21-month prospective observation following implementation of a QI intervention in adults (aged 18 yr or older) with CF. All patients with a PICC inserted from July 2006 to March 2013 at our CF Foundation-accredited center were included. Symptomatic DVT was diagnosed by Doppler ultrasound. PICC insertions were analyzed, and nine risk factors for DVT were analyzed to formulate a QI initiative to reduce risk of PICC-associated DVT. The QI program focused on staff education and included modification to PICC order entry with a 4 French (F) single-lumen (SL) catheter as standard for all patients with CF. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 369 PICCs were analyzed in 117 unique patients for a total of 5,437 PICC-days of placement. Symptomatic DVT was diagnosed in 28 (7.6%) of the 369 PICCs analyzed. Using regression analysis, the strongest predictors for DVT occurrence were warfarin use (odds ratio [OR] = 9.2, P = 0.006) and history of PICC-associated DVT (OR = 2.97, P = 0.08). Insertion of a 4F SL PICC resulted in zero symptomatic DVT. Zero episodes of DVT associated with 4F PICC insertion prevented use of PICC size in regression analysis. However, univariate analysis revealed that insertion of a 4F SL PICC instead of either 5F double lumen or 6F triple lumen was associated with a reduction in PICC-associated DVT (P = 0.001). After the QI intervention, 4F SL catheter insertion substantially increased to 65.8% of all PICCs inserted, whereas 6F triple-lumen catheter insertion declined to 6.8% of PICCs inserted. The QI initiative resulted in an absolute risk reduction in DVT per PICC placed of 6.1% (P = 0.055). CONCLUSIONS: To reduce risk of PICC-associated DVT in patients with CF, QI strategies should focus on insertion of smaller-diameter 4F PICCs and reduction in PICC use in high-risk patients when possible.

34107707,2021,"Analysis of the relationship between serum amyloid protein A, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and peripherally inserted central catheter infection in patients with malignant tumor. ","BACKGROUND: Compared with a central venous catheter, a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) has the advantages of less trauma and a lower risk of bleeding and bloodstream infection. However, patients with tumors are commonly immunocompromised and therefore susceptible to infection during the course of PICC indwelling. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between serum amyloid protein A (SAA), procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and PICC infection in patients with malignant tumor. METHODS: Patients with malignant tumor treated with PICC in Gansu Provincial Cancer Hospital from March 2017 to January 2020 were retrospectively investigated. The incidence of infection and the differences in SAA, PCT, CRP, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), fibrinogen (FIG), interleukin-18 (IL-18), and interleukin-16 (IL-6) between the infected group and noninfected group were observed. The correlations of SAA, PCT, and CRP levels in different infection sites and infection degrees were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 414 eligible patients were included with 93 in the infection group and 321 in the noninfection group. The overall incidence of infection was 22.4%. The levels of SAA, PCT and CRP in the infection group were significantly higher than those in the noninfection group (P<0.001). Compared with the non-infected group, the levels of PT, APTT, TT, IL-18 and IL-6 were significantly higher in the infected group (P<0.001). However, the level of FIG was significantly lower in the infected group (P<0.001). Compared with the local infection group, the levels of SAA, PCT, and CRP in the bloodstream infection group were significantly higher (P<0.001). Furthermore, the levels of SAA, PCT, and CRP were positively correlated with the degree of PICC catheter infection. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with malignant tumors, PICC catheter infection were associated with increased risk of bleeding and the levels of SAA, PCT, and CRP can be used as predictive diagnostic indexes for PICC catheter infection. Furthermore, these parameters were positively correlated with the degree of PICC catheter infection.

28807074,2017,A Model to Predict Central-Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection Among Patients With Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters: The MPC Score. ,"BACKGROUND Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are associated with central-line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs). However, no tools to predict risk of PICC-CLABSI have been developed. OBJECTIVE To operationalize or prioritize CLABSI risk factors when making decisions regarding the use of PICCs using a risk model to estimate an individual's risk of PICC-CLABSI prior to device placement. METHODS Using data from the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety consortium, patients that experienced PICC-CLABSI between January 2013 and October 2016 were identified. A Cox proportional hazards model with robust sandwich standard error estimates was then used to identify factors associated with PICC-CLABSI. Based on regression coefficients, points were assigned to each predictor and summed for each patient to create the Michigan PICC-CLABSI (MPC) score. The predictive performance of the score was assessed using time-dependent area-under-the-curve (AUC) values. RESULTS Of 23,088 patients that received PICCs during the study period, 249 patients (1.1%) developed a CLABSI. Significant risk factors associated with PICC-CLABSI included hematological cancer (3 points), CLABSI within 3 months of PICC insertion (2 points), multilumen PICC (2 points), solid cancers with ongoing chemotherapy (2 points), receipt of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) through the PICC (1 point), and presence of another central venous catheter (CVC) at the time of PICC placement (1 point). The MPC score was significantly associated with risk of CLABSI (P<.0001). For every point increase, the hazard ratio of CLABSI increased by 1.63 (95% confidence interval, 1.56-1.71). The area under the receiver-operating-characteristics curve was 0.67 to 0.77 for PICC dwell times of 6 to 40 days, which indicates good model calibration. CONCLUSION The MPC score offers a novel way to inform decisions regarding PICC use, surveillance of high-risk cohorts, and utility of blood cultures when PICC-CLABSI is suspected. Future studies validating the score are necessary. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2017;38:1155-1166. ",['eng'],"['Comparative Study' 'Journal Article' ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""

27091304,2016,Variation in prevalence and patterns of peripherally inserted central catheter use in adults hospitalized with pneumonia. ,"BACKGROUND: Although peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are often used in adults hospitalized with pneumonia, patterns related to PICC use in this context are unknown. METHODS: Premier's inpatient database was used to identify patients hospitalized with pneumonia between July 1, 2007 and November 30, 2011. PICC placement was identified via billing codes. Generalized estimating equations were used to identify factors associated with PICC placement. Hospital risk-standardized rates of PICC insertion were estimated using hierarchical generalized linear models. RESULTS: There were 545,250 patients (median age: 71 years; range: 57-82 years) included. A total of 41,849 (7.7%) patients received a PICC during hospitalization (median receipt: hospital day 4). PICC recipients were younger (median age: 69 years), had higher levels of comorbidity (Gagne score median: 4 vs 2) and were more often diagnosed with healthcare-associated pneumonia (43.1% vs 29.9%) than those who did not receive PICCs. The 3 patient variables most associated with PICC receipt included weight loss (odds ratio [OR]: 2.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.97-2.10), sepsis on admission (OR: 1.80, 95%CI: 1.75-1.85), and intensive care unit status on hospital day 1 or 2 (OR: 1.70, 95%CI: 1.64-1.75). Compared to internal medicine, admission by geriatricians and critical care physicians was associated with PICC placement (OR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.62-2.03 and OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.05-1.24, respectively). Risk-standardized rates of PICC utilization varied from 0.3% to 41.7%. Nearly 70% of the variability in PICC use could not be explained by available data. CONCLUSIONS: In adults hospitalized with pneumonia, PICC use appears directed towards those with severe illness and varies substantially between hospitals.

37070255,2023,The safety of peripherally inserted central venous catheters in critically ill patients: A retrospective observational study. ,"BACKGROUND: Centrally inserted central venous catheters (CICCs) are commonly placed in critically ill patients who require a central venous catheter (CVC). Recently, peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) have been widely used on general wards. However, the safety of PICCs in critically ill patients remains unclear. METHOD: We conducted a retrospective observational study at a mixed intensive care unit (ICU). Adult patients (⩾18 years) who were emergently admitted to the ICU and underwent CVC insertion between April 2019 and March 2021 were enrolled. We compared the safety of PICCs and CICCs. The primary outcome was the overall rate of catheter-related complications, including bloodstream infections, thrombosis, insertional trauma, catheter malfunction, and accidental removal. We used a stabilized inverse probability weighting (sIPW) model to estimate the effects of PICC use. RESULTS: A total of 239 CVCs (PICCs, 53; CICCs, 186) were inserted into 229 patients. Although the severity of illness did not differ significantly between the groups, the length of hospital stay and mean indwelling catheter duration were significantly longer in the PICC group. There was no significant intergroup difference in the overall rate of catheter-related complications (PICC: 9.4% vs CICC: 3.8%; odds ratio [OR]: 2.65; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.63-10.2, p = 0.145), and there were 7.7 and 9.0 complications per 1000 catheter days in the PICC and CICC groups, respectively (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.14-2.65, p = 0.513). After adjustment using the sIPW model, PICC use was not found to be associated with a reduction in catheter-related complications (adjusted OR: 3.10; 95% CI: 0.90-10.7; adjusted HR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.14-1.97). CONCLUSION: We found no significant differences in catheter-related complications between patients treated using CICCs and those treated using PICCs after emergency ICU admission. Our findings imply that PICCs may be an alternative to CICCs in critically ill patients. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],[],"['Central venous catheter' 'PICC' 'complications' 'critical illness'

30153253,2018,Self-management of peripherally inserted central catheters after patient discharge via the WeChat smartphone application: A systematic review and meta-analysis. ,"WeChat is a smartphone application that may help patients self-manage peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC), although additional data are needed regarding this topic. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine whether WeChat helped improve PICC-related complications, self-care ability, PICC maintenance dependency in that the behavior of a patient is in compliance with a doctor's order or a will, knowledge mastery, and satisfaction among patients with a PICC. The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China Biology Medicine, China national Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, Wiper, and Baidu Scholar databases were searched to identify related reports that were published up to April 2018. This search revealed 36 reports that were published during 2014-2018, including 2,623 controls and 2,662 patients who used the WeChat application. Relative to the traditional follow-up group, the group that received WeChat follow-up had a lower risk of PICC-related complications (odds ratio [OR]: 0.23, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.19-0.27, P < 0.00001), better self-care ability (mean difference: 36.41, 95% CI: 34.68-38.14, P < 0.00001), higher PICC maintenance dependency (OR: 4.27, 95% CI: 3.35-5.44, P < 0.00001), and higher patient satisfaction (OR: 6.20, 95% CI: 4.32-8.90, P < 0.00001). Eight studies reported knowledge mastery, although the different evaluation tools precluded a meta-analysis. Nevertheless, those eight studies revealed that knowledge mastery was significantly higher in the WeChat group than in the traditional follow-up group (P < 0.05). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of WeChat follow-up on self-management among patients who are discharged with a PICC. It appears that WeChat follow-up can help improve the incidence of complications, self-care ability, PICC maintenance dependence, and patient satisfaction. However, the WeChat application itself cannot improve patients' self-management ability. Further studies are needed to produce high-quality evidence to determine whether WeChat is an effective follow-up tool.

25501778,2015,Peripherally inserted central venous catheter safety in burn care: a single-center retrospective cohort review. ,"The use of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line for central venous access in thermally injured patients has increased in recent years despite a lack of evidence regarding safety in this patient population. A recent survey of invasive catheter practices among 44 burn centers in the United States found that 37% of burn units use PICC lines as part of their treatment protocol. The goal of this study was to compare PICC-associated complication rates with the existing literature in both the critical care and burn settings. The methodology involved is a single institution retrospective cohort review of patients who received a PICC line during admission to a regional burn unit between 2008 and 2013. Fifty-three patients were identified with a total of seventy-three PICC lines. The primary outcome measurement for this study was indication for PICC line discontinuation. The most common reason for PICC line discontinuation was that the line was no longer indicated (45.2%). Four cases of symptomatic upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (5.5%) and three cases of central line-associated bloodstream infection (4.3%, 2.72 infections per 1000 line days) were identified. PICC lines were in situ an average of 15 days (range 1 to 49 days). We suggest that PICC line-associated complication rates are similar to those published in the critical care literature. Though these rates are higher than those published in the burn literature, they are similar to central venous catheter-associated complication rates. While PICC lines can be a useful resource in the treatment of the thermally injured patient, they are associated with significant and potentially fatal risks.

24439240,2015,A comparative study of peripherally-inserted and Broviac catheter complications in home parenteral nutrition patients. ,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICC) have become increasingly popular for medium to long-term parenteral nutrition (PN) but there is limited data on the complication rates in this sub-group. We aimed to compare the rates of complications associated with tunneled catheters (Broviac) and PICC in home PN (HPN) patients. METHODS: All adult patients in an HPN program with a new Broviac or new PICC between 2009 and 2011 were included in this prospective observational study. Complication rates were compared by using Poisson regression and Kaplan Meier survival curves were used to compare the first complications that occurred. RESULTS: 204 catheters (133 Broviac and 71 PICC) were inserted in 196 adult patients. Mean follow-up from catheter insertions to their removal was 276 ± 219 days for Broviac (n = 86) vs. 74 ± 140.70 days for PICC (n = 56); p < 0.001. Complications were similar between Broviac and PICC (91/133 vs. 26/71). Catheter infection rate was lower in PICC (1.87 vs. 1.05 per 1000 catheter-days; p = 0.01). Catheter obstruction rates were similar for both catheters. Only PICC experienced venous thrombosis (0.4/1000). The proportion of catheters removed was lower in the Broviac group than in the PICC group (62.4% vs. 78.8%; p = 0.01) but those removed for complications were not different (28.6.7%vs. 25.3%; p = 0.64). CONCLUSIONS: In HPN patients, overall complications were similar in both the PICC and the Broviac groups. However, the Broviac catheter could be associated with an increase in catheter infection.

37731133,2023,The safe implementation of peripherally inserted central catheters by nurse practitioners for patients with gastroenterological diseases in Japan: a single-center retrospective study. ,"PURPOSE: As a safe and reliable alternative to central venous catheters (CVCs), peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are commonly used in clinical practice. However, the insertion of PICCs by nurse practitioners (NPs), especially in Japan, has not been reported extensively. Thus, we investigated the safety and efficiency of PICC insertions by NPs. METHODS: The participants were 1322 patients who underwent PICC insertion by NPs at Fujita Health University Hospital (FNPs). The basilic vein in the brachium was the preferred vein for insertion; the brachial vein was the alternative. Patients were monitored from the time of PICC insertion until its removal. Ultrasonography-guided puncture was used for all catheter insertions, and the catheter tip was replaced into the superior vena cava under fluoroscopic imaging with maximal sterile barrier precautions. The outcomes of the PICC insertions by the FNPs were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: Overall, 23 FNPs inserted a collective total of 1322 PICCs, which remained in place for a collective total of 23,619 catheter days. The rate of successful PICC insertion was 99% (1310 patients). The median time taken for PICC insertion was 12 min (interquartile range, 10-15 min). Intraoperative complications occurred in two patients (0.2%). The confirmed incidence of central line-associated bloodstream infection was 3.4% (45 patients), and these infections occurred on 1.9 per 1000 catheter days. The median duration of PICC placement was 15 days (range, 10-23 days). CONCLUSION: PICC insertion by NPs is safe and a potential alternative to CVC insertion by surgeons.

23876203,2013,Prospective follow-up of complications related to peripherally inserted central catheters. ,"An increased use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) in French hospitals has been observed in recent years. We report complications having occurred following the placement of PICC in a teaching hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study was made for 7 months, between October 2010 and April 2011, including all patients having undergone PICC placement in interventional radiology. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-seven PICC were inserted in 222 patients for intravenous antibiotic therapy (68%), parenteral nutrition (13%), or chemotherapy (9%). The median duration of PICC use was 17 days (min-max: 1-140) for the 200 PICC monitored until removal. The most common complication was obstruction (n=41), 16 of which motivated PICC removal (8%). Five cases of vein thrombosis (2.5%) and 20 infectious complications (10%) led to removal. There were 14 accidental removals (7%). The overall infection rate was 2.3 per 1000 catheter-days with 0.86 per 1000 catheter-days for central line-associated bloodstream infection. Thirty-four percent of PICC were removed without any complications without any difference according to use. CONCLUSION: PICC are a simple alternative to standard central venous catheter but the rate of complications is high and could be decreased by a stringent management and training for this type of catheter.

37589262,2023,Multivariate analysis of medical adhesive-related skin injury at the site of peripherally inserted central catheter insertion in cancer patients: A prospective cohort study. ,"OBJECTIVE: At the site of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) catheterization in tumor patients, medical adhesive-related skin injury (MARSI) was reported related to patient age, infusion of certain chemotherapeutic agents, and tumor type, but did not review its relation to the use of clear patches and the puncture site of PICC. This study aims to analyze the risk factors for MARSI in more detail to provide supported data for reducing MARSI. METHOD: Total 382 cancer patients receiving catheterization via PICC were involved in this study from March 1, 2021, to September 28, 2021. According to MARSI occurrence or not, they were assigned into MARSI or non-MARSI group. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to analyze the risks of MARSI occurrence at PICC insertion site. RESULTS: 15% (60 of 382 cases) resulted in MARSI, out of which 8.1% (31/382) was categorized as contact dermatitis, and 7.1% (27/382) as mechanical injuries. The univariate analysis showed that there were significant differences in six aspects of the study, including BMI, MARSI history, dressing types, treatment by paclitaxel or 5-FU versus oxaliplatin, dressing frequency, and catheterization at biceps brachii medial (p < 0.05). Via multivariate logistic regression analysis, it was discovered that except for previously reported risk factors, dressing change frequency (OR (95% CI) = 7.49 (2.36-23.80), p = 0.001), catheterization at biceps brachii medial (OR (95% CI) = 4.07 (1.82-9.10), p = 0.001), and breast cancer (OR (95% CI) = 3.27 (1.05-10.15), p = 0.041), there were significant risk factors for MARSI occurrence in tumor patients with PICC catheterization. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed a high incidence of MARSI at the PICC insertion site of cancer patients, presenting with contact dermatitis and mechanical injury. Independent risk factors were previous history of MARSI, a diagnosis of breast cancer, frequent dressing replacement, use of paclitaxel or 5-FU, and PICC catheterization at biceps brachii medial.

25935657,2016,A team-based multidisciplinary approach to managing peripherally inserted central catheter complications in high-risk haematological patients: a prospective study. ,"PURPOSE: Use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) has markedly increased during the last decade. However, there are few studies on use of PICCs in patients with haematological malignancies (HM) receiving intensive chemotherapy. Preliminary data suggest a higher rate of PICC-related complications in these high-risk patients. This prospective observational single-centre study aimed to investigate PICC-related complications after implementation of a multidisciplinary approach to PICC care and compared it with previous literature. METHODS: A total of 44 PICCs were inserted in 36 patients (27.3%, thrombocytopenia <50 × 10(9)/L at insertion) over 5045 PICC days (median duration, 114.5 days). RESULTS: No major insertion-related complications were observed. Major late complications were obstruction in 13.6% (1.19/1000 PICC days) of patients, catheter-related bloodstream infection in 6.8% (0.59/1000 PICC days), and catheter-related thrombosis in 4.5% (0.39/1000 PICC days). Premature PICC removal occurred in 34% (2.97/1000 PICC days) of patients. The overall rate of potentially major dangerous complications was particularly low (11.36%, 0.99/1000 PICC days) compared with previous studies. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the utility of a multidisciplinary approach for PICC care in adults with HM receiving intensive chemotherapy. We provide further data to support use of PICCs in such patient populations. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Adolescent' 'Adult' 'Aged' 'Catheter-Related Infections/*etiology'

31150465,2019,Safety and feasibility of ultrasound-guided placement of peripherally inserted central catheter performed by neurointensivist in neurosurgery intensive care unit. ,"We evaluated the safety and feasibility of ultrasound-guided peripherally-inserted central venous catheters (PICC) by a neurointensivist at the bedside compared to fluoroscopy-guided PICC and conventional central venous catheter (CCVC). This was a retrospective study of adult patients who underwent central line placement and were admitted to the neurosurgical intensive care unit (ICU) between January 2014 and March 2018. In this study, the primary endpoint was central line-induced complications. The secondary endpoint was initial success of central line placement. Placements of ultrasound-guided PICC and CCVC performed at the bedside if intra-hospital transport was inappropriate. Other patients underwent PICC placement at the interventional radiology suite under fluoroscopic guidance. A total of 191 patients underwent central line placement in the neurosurgery ICU during the study period. Requirement for central line infusion (56.0%) and difficult venous access (28.8%) were the most common reasons for central line placement. The basilic vein (39.3%) and the subclavian vein (35.1%) were the most common target veins among patients who underwent central line placement. The placements of ultrasound-guided PICC and CCVC at the bedside were more frequently performed in patients on mechanical ventilation (p = 0.001) and with hemodynamic instability (p <0.001) compared to the fluoroscopy-guided PICC placement. The initial success rate of central line placement was better in the fluoroscopy-guided PICC placement than in the placements of ultrasound-guided PICC and CCVC at the bedside (p = 0.004). However, all re-inserted central lines were successful. There was no significant difference in procedure time between the three groups. However, incidence of insertional injuries was higher in CCVC group compared to PICC groups (p = 0.038). Ultrasound-guided PICC placement by a neurointensivist may be safe and feasible compared to fluoroscopy-guided PICC placement by interventional radiologists and CCVC placement for neurocritically ill patients.

Despite many advantages, PICC-related complications can occur such as infection, thrombosis or mechanical complications. We aimed to evaluate rates and nature of PICC-related complications from insertion to removal and analyze risk factors of complications at baseline and during healthcare. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study looking at PICC-related complication rates in the inpatient and outpatient settings of 163 patients over a 7-month period. Pertinent patient demographics as well as catheter-related factors were collected. The data were analyzed to identify catheter-related complications using univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-two PICCs were monitored for a total of 5218 PICC-days (3337 PICC-days for inpatients, 1881 PICC-days for outpatients). The overall complication rate was 30.2% (11.1 per 1000 PICC-days) with a mean time to onset of 16.1 days. Complications included occlusion (8.9%), accidental withdrawal (8.9%), infections (6.3%) including 9 local infections (4.7%) and 3 bloodstream infections (1.6%), venous thrombosis (1.6%) and hematoma (1%). Complication rate was higher in the hospitalization setting (36.1%; 14.38 per 1000 PICC-days) than in the outpatient setting (19.4%; 3.19 per 1000 PICC-days). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the occurrence of occlusion was significantly associated with an age > 65 years (OR = 4.19; 95% CI [1.1-15.81]) and the presence of a pre-occlusive event the week before PICC removal (OR = 76.35; 95% CI [9.36-622.97]). CONCLUSIONS: PICCs appear safe in the inpatient and outpatient settings with low rates of infectious or thrombotic complications. Occlusion and accidental withdrawal were the most common complications, with age > 65 and catheter pre-occlusive event associated with an increased likelihood of catheter occlusion.

29271078,2018,Immediate post-insertion tip migration of peripherally inserted central catheters dependent on arm position and depth of inspiration. ,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is to assess the degree of PICC tip migration with breathing and arm movement to determine whether accurate positioning is feasible or futile. METHODS: A prospective cohort of 218 consecutive patients undergoing PICC insertion at our institution between January and August 2015 was selected, of which 129 met inclusion criteria. The position of insertion was used as control with the arm at 90° during inspiration, followed by three study images: expiration with arm unchanged, inspiration with arm fully adducted and inspiration with arm fully abducted. Mean and standard deviations (SD) of change in PICC position were determined. ANOVA, Pearson correlation coefficients and Chi-square tests were used to assess the effects of vessel choice, PICC calibre and angle of arm abduction. Complications were recorded. RESULTS: Movement was predominantly caudal with a mean of 10.4 mm (SD 16.5) with similar degrees of movement in the expiration (12.3 mm) and adduction (12.9 mm) views (P = 0.709). Arm abduction resulted in a mean caudal movement of 6.5 mm. (SD 18.6); however, the degree of abduction had no predictable effect on PICC movement. Thirty-two per cent of cases demonstrated movement into the right atrium. Neither vessel choice nor type of PICC was shown to have a significant effect on PICC movement. CONCLUSION: There is large amplitude of PICC tip position change with depth of inspiration and arm position resulting in frequent right atrial position. Despite this there were no associated complications in our cohort which compliments emerging international opinion regarding intra-atrial PICC tip position.

31658097,2019,Nursing Interventions to Reduce Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter Occlusion for Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review of Literature. ,"BACKGROUND: Cancer patients are considered the most at risk of the consequences of catheter occlusion. Therefore, nursing interventions that can effectively reduce the occlusion of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines must be identified to ensure a smooth treatment. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate nursing interventions to minimize PICC line occlusion and make recommended measures for preventing or decreasing occlusion and abnormal extubation. METHODS: Studies about PICC occlusion that were published up to January 2017 were searched and screened in PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct (Elsevier), EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Chinese databases CNKI and Wanfang. Two independent reviewers screened the literature in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria, assessed the quality of the included studies, and extracted the data. Further meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3. RESULTS: Thirteen trials were included. Meta-analysis revealed that education for nurses (relative risk, 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.19-0.51; P < .00001) was significantly associated with PICC occlusion, whereas PICC type (relative risk, 0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-1.15; P = .12) was not significantly associated with PICC occlusion. The solution to washing pipes and the PICC insertion techniques were descriptively analyzed to reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: This study determined the correlation of PICC occlusion with the nurses' knowledge and skills, PICC types, flushing liquid and methods, and insertion techniques. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The findings of this study can serve as a guide for clinical work and for developing targeted measures to reduce occlusion.

30912181,2019,"A retrospective study of the safety of over 100,000 peripherally-inserted central catheters days for parenteral supportive treatments. ","The type of central vascular access device providers chosen for providing parenteral supportive treatments has evolved over the past years, going from routinely used centrally inserted catheters to a more recent trend of peripherally-inserted central catheters (PICCs) when expected treatment duration is less than 6 months. This multicenter retrospective study aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment of the safety of PICCs in administering parenteral supportive treatments. All adult inpatients and outpatients who had a PICC inserted for the administration of parenteral supportive treatments (i.e., parenteral nutrition, intravenous fluids, blood products, or antibiotics) between September 2007 and December 2014 in four public Italian hospitals were included. The primary outcome was PICC removal because of an adverse event (AE, defined as occlusion, exit-site infection, or symptomatic thrombosis). Among the 1,250 included patients, 178 PICC-related removals because of AEs (14.2%; 1.62 AEs per 1,000 PICC days) were reported. Rates of PICC removal because of occlusion, exit-site infection, and symptomatic thrombosis were 1.08, 0.32, and 0.23 per 1,000 PICC days, respectively. The median dwell-time between PICC insertion and its removal because of an AE was 67 days (interquartile range 28-180 days). Risk of PICC removal due to AE was higher with open-system PICCs [hazard ratio = 2.75, 95% confidence interval 1.52-4.96]. In this study, we found preliminary evidence that PICCs can be safely used to administer parenteral supportive treatments lasting up to 6 months. PICCs may be a relevant alternative to centrally inserted catheters for medium-term parenteral supportive treatments.

30755503,2019,"Can Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters Be Safely Placed in Patients with Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy? A Retrospective Study of Almost 400,000 Catheter-Days. ","BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are central venous catheters (CVCs) that are commonly used in onco-hematologic settings for chemotherapy administration. As there is insufficient evidence to recommend a specific CVC for chemotherapy administration, we aimed to ascertain PICC-related adverse events (AEs) and identify independent predictors of PICC removal in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information on adult patients with cancer with a PICC inserted for chemotherapy administration between September 2007 and December 2014 was extracted from six hospital databases. The primary outcome was PICC removal due to PICC-related AEs (occlusion, infection, or symptomatic thrombosis). Independent predictors of PICC removal were identified using a multivariate Cox regression model. RESULTS: Among the 2,477 included patients, 419 PICC-related AEs (16.9%; 1.09 AEs per 1,000 PICC-days) were reported. AEs increased when PICC was inserted at the brachial site (hazard ratio [HR], 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.84) and with open systems (HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.24-2.88) and decreased in older men (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.49-0.81). CONCLUSION: Use of PICC for chemotherapy administration was associated with a low all-AEs rate. The basilic vein was the safer site, and valved systems had fewer AEs than open systems. More research is needed to explore the interaction between AEs, sex, and age. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: These findings provide clinicians with evidence that peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are safe for chemotherapy administration. They also suggest that clinicians should limit the use of open systems when long chemotherapy regimens are scheduled. Moreover, alternatives to PICCs should be considered when administering chemotherapy to young men. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Aged' 'Catheterization, Peripheral/*adverse effects'

This study was to investigate the incidence and risk factors of PICC-related upper extremity vein thrombosis in cancer patients. METHODS: This was a prospective study conducted in two tertiary referral hospitals from May 2010 to February 2013. Cancer patients who were subject to PICC placement were enrolled and checked by Doppler ultrasound weekly for at least 1 month. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied for identification of risk factors. RESULTS: Three hundred and eleven cancer patients were enrolled in the study. One hundred and sixty (51.4%) developed PICC thrombosis, of which 87 (54.4%) cases were symptomatic. The mean time interval from PICC insertion to thrombosis onset was 11.04±5.538 days. The univariable logistic regression analysis showed that complications (odds ratio [OR] 1.686, P=0.032), less activity (OR 1.476, P=0.006), obesity (OR 3.148, P=0.000), and chemotherapy history (OR 3.405, P=0.030) were associated with PICC thrombosis. Multivariate analysis showed that less activity (OR 9.583, P=0.000) and obesity (OR 3.466, P=0.014) were significantly associated with PICC thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of PICC thrombosis is relatively high, and nearly half are asymptomatic. Less activity and obesity are risk factors of PICC-related thrombosis.

34470985,2021,Changes in Central Venous Catheter Use in the Hematology Unit with the Introduction of Ultrasound Guidance and a Peripherally Inserted Central Venous Catheter. ,"Objective A central venous catheter (CVC) is often needed to treat hematologic diseases, but it is accompanied by many complications. Ultrasound guidance (USG) or a peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) can reduce such complications. Meterials We collected data of patients with attempted CVC placement in our hematology unit in 2012 (before introduction of USG and PICC) and 2018 (after introduction) and compared both periods. Results In total, 187 CVC insertions were attempted in 2018 and 198 in 2012. USG was used 154 times (82%) in 2018 and 4 times (2%) in 2012 (p<0.001). The success rates of insertion were 95% in 2018 and 89% in 2012 (p=0.063). The incidence of acute complications was 4.3% in 2018 and 9.1% in 2012 (p=0.069). The incidence of CVC removal owing to delayed complications was 26% in 2018 and 21% in 2012 (p=0.327). The sites of approach in 2018 and 2012 were the internal jugular in 42 (22%) and 54 (27%), subclavian in 52 (28%) and 128 (65%), brachial (PICC) in 89 (48%) and 14 (7%), and femoral in 4 (2%) and 2 (1%), respectively (p<0.001). Conclusion USG has become commonplace since its introduction. The landmark-based subclavian approach was largely replaced by PICC with USG in 2018.

We prospectively determined the frequency of haemorrhagic complications of PICC placement in cancer patients with uncorrected profound thrombocytopaenia. METHODS: Profound thrombocytopaenia was defined as a platelet count <50 × 10(9)/l. No patients received transfusions before or after the procedure. Three types of adverse effects were analysed: minor oozing, mild haematoma and major haemorrhage. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-three PICC implantations in 101 cancer patients were prospectively included in the study: seven patients (7 %) had a solid tumour and 94 (93 %) a haematological malignancy. Among these 143 procedures in thrombocytopaenic patients, 93 (65 %) were performed with a platelet count 20-50 × 10(9)/l and 50 (35 %) had lower than 20 × 10(9)/l. No major haemorrhage was observed. Minor oozing was observed in six implantations (4 %) and mild haematoma in two (1.5 %), for a total of eight minor haemorrhagic adverse events (5.5 %). In patients with a platelet count <20 × 10(9)/l, 1/50 (2 %) had minor oozing and none had minor haematoma. CONCLUSIONS: In cancer patients with uncorrected profound thrombocytopaenia, the incidence of adverse events after PICC implantation was low, and was limited to minor haemorrhagic adverse events. KEY POINTS: • PICC placement has high technical success in profound thrombocytopaenic cancer patients. • Few adverse events are encountered after PICC placement, limited to minor haemorrhage. • PICC placement does not routinely require platelet transfusion in patients with thrombocytopaenia. • Such PICC placement still seems safe when the platelet count is <20 × 10 (9) /l.

METHODS: Twenty-five ALS patients in the later stages of the disease underwent PICC insertion followed by parenteral nutrition (PN). For all of them, gastrostomy was non-feasible. Patients were followed until death and monitored for complications. RESULTS: PICC insertion was successful in all patients. Three months after insertion, the mean body weight increased by 4.5% (p = 0.0057). PICC could be maintained until death in all but 1 patient. The mean delay between insertion and death was 4.5 months, but PN was administered for more than 1 year in 2 patients. Complications were noted in 6 patients: sepsis (n = 4), venous thrombosis (n = 1), and upper limb oedema (n = 1), none of them resulting in death. CONCLUSION: PICC insertion for PN at a later stage of ALS, in patients for whom gastrostomy is non-feasible, appears to be a useful option compared to the central venous catheter.

25665735,2015,Use of blind placements of peripherally inserted central catheters in burn patients: a retrospective analysis. ,"INTRODUCTION: Safe and reliable vascular access is essential for the treatment and care of burn patients. Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are widely used for various groups of critically and chronically ill patients. However, the information about PICC use and management for burn patients is limited. METHODS: The Institutional Review Board approved retrospective cohort chart review included all burn patients at a single center who received one or more PICCs (n=106). Blind PICCs were placed by an intravenous clinical nurse specialist (IV CNS). Data were collected from PICC records and included general demographics, as well as PICC insertions, management, and removals. RESULTS: About 42% of cases were in the cubital vein, 39% in the basilar, 14% in the cephalic, and 3% in the brachial veins. In 75% of the cases, gauze dressing was identified as the primary form of routine PICC nursing care. About 62% of all patients had their dressings changed every 48h and 37.5% had dressings changed daily. The average length of time each PICC remained in place was 18.5 days. About 16% of the cases were identified as having PICC-related complications, including one infection, two occlusions (2%), one edema at insertion place (1%), and 12 cases of mechanical phlebitis. CONCLUSION: Although PICCs are adequate for burn patient care, there are no protocols or guidelines covering rational and safe usage of PICCs. Standard guidelines on PICC placement and management specifically for burn patient should be developed. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Adult' 'Aged' 'Burns/*therapy' 'Catheter Obstruction/etiology'

33746117,2021,Prevention of hematogenous infection in peripheral venous catheterization with integrated medical assistance in patients undergoing chemotherapy. ,"OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at verifying the effect of specific management modalities aimed at reducing or preventing the incidence of infections in the blood flow in relation to the use of the central venous catheter (CRBSI = catheterrelated bloodstream infection) in patients undergoing chemotherapy. METHODS: 36 patients (n = 36) with a peripherally inserted venous catheter (PICC) were enrolled in the integrated medical treatment group, while 128 patients with an internal central venous catheter were enrolled in the control group. The patients in the control group underwent routine nursing, while the patients in the treatment group underwent integrated surveillance control infection treatment by doctors and were compared between these two groups l incidence of complications, CRBSI. RESULTS: The incidence of complications of the CRBSI type was significantly lower in the whole treatment group than in the control group and the difference was statistically significant (p <0.05). CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the implementation of the infection control management modality within the integration of medical care for PICC chemotherapy patients in the Oncology Department can effectively reduce the incidence of infectious complications in the bloodstream, and improve the level of nursing care in peripheral venous catheterization (PICC) with improved patient satisfaction.

29872323,2018,The incidence and predictors of symptomatic venous thromboembolism associated with peripherally inserted central catheters in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. ,"BACKGROUND: Despite wide usage, peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)-related venous thromboembolism (VTE) is common in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of NPC patients with PICC insertions from February 2, 2007 to December 25, 2014 in Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Centre. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the correlations between risk factors and symptomatic PICC-VTE. RESULTS: Of the 1,363 NPC patients, 76 developed symptomatic VTE. In univariable analysis, body mass index (BMI), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score, metastasis stage (M stage), and VTE history were associated with symptomatic PICC-VTE. Following multivariable adjustments, BMI (OR 0.900, p=0.007), ECOG score (OR 4.162, p=0.011), M stage (OR 2.717, p=0.019), and VTE history (OR 109.772, p<0.001) were still statistically significant. CONCLUSION: PICC-VTE is a common complication in NPC patients, with an incidence of 5.6% in our analysis. Those with VTE history and lower BMI and worse ECOG performance score metastatic NPC patients are more susceptible to symptomatic PICC-related thrombosis and thus may require prophylactic anticoagulation.

25664112,2014,Risk factors for venous thrombosis associated with peripherally inserted central venous catheters. ,"To evaluate the risk factors associated with an increased risk of symptomatic peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC)-related venous thrombosis. Retrospective analyses identified 2313 patients who received PICCs from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2013. All 11 patients with symptomatic PICC-related venous thrombosis (thrombosis group) and 148 who did not have thromboses (non-thrombosis group) were selected randomly. The medical information of 159 patients (age, body mass index (BMI), diagnosis, smoking history, nutritional risk score, platelet count, leucocyte count as well as levels of D-dimer, fibrinogen, and degradation products of fibrin) were collected. Logistic regression analysis was undertaken to determine the risk factors for thrombosis. Of 2313 patients, 11 (0.47%) were found to have symptomatic PICC-related venous thrombosis by color Doppler ultrasound. Being bedridden for a long time (odds ratio [(OR]), 17.774; P=0.0017), D-dimer >5 mg/L (36.651; 0.0025) and suffering from one comorbidity (8.39; 0.0265) or more comorbidities (13.705; 0.0083) were the major risk factors for PICC-catheter related venous thrombosis by stepwise logistic regression analysis. Among 159 patients, the prevalence of PICC-associated venous thrombosis in those with ≥1 risk factor was 10.34% (12/116), in those with ≥2 risk factors was 20.41% (10/49), and in those with >3 risk factors was 26.67% (4/15). Being bedridden >72 h, having increased levels of D-dimer (>5 mg/L) and suffering from comorbidities were independent risk factors of PICC-related venous thrombosis.

27033138,2016,Limiting the Number of Lumens in Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters to Improve Outcomes and Reduce Cost: A Simulation Study. ,"BACKGROUND The number of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lumens is associated with thrombotic and infectious complications. Because multilumen PICCs are not necessary in all patients, policies that limit their use may improve safety and cost. OBJECTIVE To design a simulation-based analysis to estimate outcomes and cost associated with a policy that encourages single-lumen PICC use. METHODS Model inputs, including risk of complications and costs associated with single- and multilumen PICCs, were obtained from available literature and a multihospital collaborative quality improvement project. Cost savings and reduction in central line-associated bloodstream infection and deep vein thrombosis events from institution of a single-lumen PICC default policy were reported. RESULTS According to our model, a hospital that places 1,000 PICCs per year (25% of which are single-lumen and 75% multilumen) experiences annual PICC-related maintenance and complication costs of $1,228,598 (95% CI, $1,053,175-$1,430,958). In such facilities, every 5% increase in single-lumen PICC use would prevent 0.5 PICC-related central line-associated bloodstream infections and 0.5 PICC-related deep vein thrombosis events, while saving $23,500. Moving from 25% to 50% single-lumen PICC utilization would result in total savings of $119,283 (95% CI, $74,030-$184,170) per year. Regardless of baseline prevalence, a single-lumen default PICC policy would be associated with approximately 10% cost savings. Findings remained robust in multiway sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION Hospital policies that limit the number of PICC lumens may enhance patient safety and reduce healthcare costs. Studies measuring intended and unintended consequences of this approach, followed by rapid adoption, appear necessary. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2016;37:811-817.

29552318,2018,Risk associated with central catheters for malignant tumor patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis. ,"The risk of venous thrombosis and mortality associated with central catheter (PICC/CICC) for malignant tumor patients is not definite. So, we carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate it. Among patients with comparing PICC with CICC, odds ratio (OR) or risk ratio (RR) was calculated with a random effect model meta-analysis. The result of the stratification analysis of 7 studies (PICC vs CICC) supported the theory that CICCs were associated with a decrease in the odds ratio of thrombosis compared with PICCs. 7 of 15 studies provided the information about the compared mortality rate of the patients. The result showed that CICCs were associated with a decrease in the odds ratio of thrombosis compared with PICCs (OR = 0.45, 95% CI:0.32-0.62, p < 0.0001, I(2) = 0%,Tau(2) = 0.00). Meta-analysis of 8 studies of 2639 patients showed that pharmacological deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis drugs could decrease the risk of mortality of malignant tumor patients with CICCs (RR = 0.58, 95% CI:0.48-0.71, Z = 5.32, p < 0.0001, I(2) = 71%). We found that PICCs are associated with a raised risk of deep vein thrombosis, and pharmacological deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis drugs is a beneficial factor in decreasing the incidence of thrombosis, while warfarin may decrease the risk of mortality of malignant tumor patients with CICCs.

32057552,2020,Peripherally inserted central venous catheter placed and maintained by a dedicated nursing team for the administration of antimicrobial therapy vs. another type of catheter: a retrospective case-control study. ,"INTRODUCTION: Data concerning the use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) for the administration of intravenous (IV) antimicrobials in the acute care setting is scarce. METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective case-control study (1:1). Case subjects were defined as patients who received IV antimicrobial treatment through a PICC line placed and maintained by specifically trained nurses (PICC group). Control subjects were defined as patients who received antimicrobial therapy by a peripheral or a central venous catheter (CVC) (control group). Control subjects were matched by type of antimicrobial, causative microorganism of the infection that was being treated and duration of treatment. An event leading to undesired catheter removal (ELUCR) was defined as any circumstance which lead to the removal of the indwelling catheter other than the completion of the scheduled course of antimicrobial therapy. RESULTS: The study included 50 patients in each group. The total follow-up time was 1376 catheter-days for the PICC group and 1362 catheter-days for the control group. We observed a significantly lower incidence of ELUCR in the PICC group (0.2 versus 7.7 events per 100 catheter-days; P<0.001). When the incidence of ELUCR was analyzed according to the duration of indwelling catheterisation for each type of catheter (divided into one-week intervals), differences between both groups were also significant (P-values≤0.001 for the first three weeks of treatment). During the second week of IV treatment, only one patient in the PICC group (2.1%) developed an ELUCR compared to 19 (38.8%) in the control group (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A PICC placed and maintained by a dedicated nursing team is an excellent alternative to peripheral venous catheters or CVCs for administrating antimicrobial therapy for both short and long periods of treatment.

26900912,2016,Impact of a Surgeon-Led Peripherally Inserted Central Venous Catheter Team on Peripherally Inserted Central Venous Catheter-Related Complications and Costs. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) are popular for a broad range of indications. As with other forms of central access, PICC use can be associated with serious and potentially costly complications. In 2000, in response to the rising popularity of PICC use, a surgeon-led team was created to steward their placement. All requests were screened rigorously to ensure rational use. Our hypothesis was that creation of a dedicated PICC team would decrease inappropriate PICC placement, overall complication rates, and cost. METHODS: The study was a retrospective review of prospectively collected data captured in the PICC team-maintained database between 2000 and 2013. The database was reviewed for PICC indications, reasons PICC requests were denied, and septic or thrombotic complications after PICC placement. To estimate cost savings, PICC supplies and each occurrence of blood stream infection (BSI) and thrombotic complication was assigned a cost on the basis of the available literature. RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2013, 35,651 PICC placements were requested, of which 24,638 (69.1%) were approved, 22,157 (62.1%) immediately and 2,481 (6.9%) after initial refusal in view of further review of the indications. Most (95%) of the PICCs inserted were placed at the bedside within 1 d of approval. Blood stream infections occurred in 5.9% of patients and thrombosis in 2.7%. The attributable costs saved by declining placement of unnecessary PICCs, assuming the same proportions of patients would have developed a complication, could be as high as $5.4 million (M) in supplies, $7.77 M in avoided BSI and $2.25 M in avoided thrombotic complications, for a total savings of $15.44 M. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a surgeon-led PICC team had a significant impact on the placement rate, reducing cost by supplies foregone and complications avoided. Cost savings related to PICC placement alone should be considered as the definite cost savings because of the judicious allocation of resources.

27500259,2016,Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism in Liver Transplant Patients: Risks and Prevention. ,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are surgical complications estimated to occur in 5% to 10% of patients. There are limited data regarding DVT/PE in the early postoperative period in liver transplant patients. The aim of this study is to determine risk factors that influence the incidence of DVT/PE and the effectiveness of prophylaxis. METHODS: We reviewed the records of 999 patients who underwent initial liver transplant between January 2000 and June 2012 at Henry Ford Hospital. In 2011, a standardized prophylactic regimen using subcutaneous (SQ) heparin was initiated. All patients that developed either upper/lower extremity DVT or PE within the first 30 days of transplant formed the cohort of this study. RESULTS: On multivariate analysis, only peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placement and SQ heparin were associated with DVT/PE. In patients receiving heparin, 3 (1.0%) had DVT/PE versus 25 (3.5%) who did not receive heparin (P = 0.03). Sixteen (6.9%) patients that had a PICC developed DVT/PE compared with 12 (1.6%) patients without a PICC (P < 0.001). In the heparin group, DVT/PE with PICC was reduced to 3 (3.0%) versus 13 (9.9%) in those with a PICC and did not receive heparin (P = 0.03). Mean time from transplant to DVT/PE diagnosis was 12.3 days. Length of hospitalization was significantly longer in patients who developed DVT/PE (18.5 vs 10.0 days, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we demonstrated that PICC placement significantly increases the likelihood of DVT/PE in liver transplant recipients. Prophylactic SQ heparin effectively reduced DVT/PE events in this patient population. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],[],[]
29148004,2018,"Cephalad dislocation of PICCs under different upper limb positions: influence of age, gender, BMI, number of lumens. ","PURPOSE: To evaluate parameters that influence the amount of movement of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) tips regarding upper limb movement. METHODS: In a prospective 12-month observational study, 200 PICCs were implanted in 162 patients (mean age 56.8 ± 15.2 years) by interventional radiologists into the basilic vein of the mid-aspect of the upper arm. Three PICC tip positions were documented with a chest x-ray: patient supine with an abducted (90°), an adducted arm, and in an upright position with an adducted arm. Multivariable analyses were performed, based on the three positions: body mass index (BMI), number of lumens, age, gender, side of the implantation, and brand. RESULTS: Up to 88% of the PICCs dislocated in a mean of 19 mm cephalad when the patient was positioned from a supine in an upright position. The greatest influence upon dislocation was the position change from supine to upright. The side of the implanted PICC (left vs. right) had no influence. CONCLUSIONS: Cephalad dislocations of mean 19 mm regularly occur in the upright position induced by gravity. This needs to be taken in account and the PICC should be safely positioned one vertebra lower in the superior vena cava superior with a last confirmation of the PICC placement in an upright position.

","PURPOSE: Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) spontaneous dislodgment is insidious in onset and prone to cause complications. We performed a prospective cohort study to examine the incidence, risk factors and clinical results of PICC spontaneous dislodgment in oncology patients to facilitate successful early diagnosis, prophylaxis and management. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive oncology patients, undergoing placement of PICCs, were enrolled and prospectively followed up until their catheters were removed or PICC spontaneous dislodgment presented. The patients with PICC spontaneous dislodgment or catheter-associated thrombosis (CRT) were followed up for an extra three months from the date of diagnosis. The main endpoint was PICC spontaneous dislodgment, and the sub-endpoints were CRT and catheter in-place time. The PICC insertion team, nurses, interventional radiologists and oncology doctors collected longitudinal data. RESULTS: Over a total of 60,894 days of cumulative follow-up, 21 out of 510 PICCs presented spontaneous dislodgment, leading to an incidence rate of 4.12%. The CRT rate of the group with PICC spontaneous dislodgment was much higher than that of the group without PICC spontaneous dislodgment (RR=17.46, 95% CI: 8.29-36.82, p=1.09×10(-17)). Five baseline exposure factors, including primary lung cancer, metastatic lung cancer, chest radiotherapy, vigorous coughing and severe vomiting, were significant risk factors of PICC spontaneous dislodgment. Basilic vein access (odds ratio [OR]=0.39, 95% CI: 0.16-0.95, P=0.04) was a protective factor against PICCSD in univariate analysis. Among these factors, the independent significant risk factors were vigorous coughing (OR=6.14, 95% CI: 1.70-22.16, P=0.01) and severe vomiting (OR=3.70, 95% CI: 1.28-10.68, P=0.02). CONCLUSION: The incidence rate of PICC spontaneous dislodgment is 4.12% (0.34 per 1000 catheter-days); PICC spontaneous dislodgment significantly increases the risk of CRT and shortens catheter in-place time. Vigorous coughing and severe vomiting were independent risk factors of PICC spontaneous dislodgment among oncology patients.

","BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) removed prematurely for unconfirmed infection or thrombosis lead to subsequent reinsertions and associated complications. To improve clinical quality, a mandatory electronic communication tool (MECT) based on clinical practice guidelines was mandated for all inpatient adult PICCs in an academically affiliated tertiary medical center. This MECT facilitated early communication and specialized evaluation with the PICC team for any complications related to PICCs. METHODS: A historical cohort study was conducted. Quality and cost measurements for 200 PICCs postinstitution of a MECT were compared with 200 PICCs 12 months prior. PICC removal and complication rates were compared for the 2 cohorts. RESULTS: Significant outcomes included a central-line associated blood stream infection rate that changed from 1.38/1,000 catheter days to 0/1,000 catheter days, 0 provider-led premature PICC removals, an overall 84% decrease in premature PICC removals (from 16%-2.5%; P < .0001), a decrease in the total complication rate from 45.5%-24% (P < .0001), and 25% reduction in radiology costs.

24052764,2013,Bridging the gap: a collaborative to reduce peripherally inserted central catheter infections in the home care environment. ,"BACKGROUND: Ochsner Health System agreed to participate in a nationwide collaboration to reduce central line infections in our intensive care units. Our outpatient peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) infection rate was unacceptably high, so as an adjunct to the nationwide study we attempted to reduce PICC infections in the home care environment. Typically, home health nurses or outpatient infusion centers care for PICCs per protocol. However, no standardized protocol exists, and each facility may have a different way to care for PICCs, leading to varied and inconsistent maintenance. METHODS: Key members from our hospital, home health agencies, and an infusion company formulated a plan to reduce outpatient PICC infections. We hypothesized that the only way to reduce infections was to standardize line care and maintenance and to empower the patient to be an advocate for his or her care. The best avenue for achieving standardized care across multiple infusion companies and multiple home health agencies was to develop an order set for PICC care and dressing changes. We also developed a checklist for the nurse and the patient to complete together during dressing changes. The checklist and order set were linked to the hospital's home health discharge orders so that they would print automatically when the provider discharged the patient to home health care. RESULTS: Baseline data were collected from July 1, 2010, to June 30, 2011. During that time, the infusion company identified 20 PICC infections. In 20,773 line days, the infection rate was 0.963 per 1,000 line days. The new order sets and checklists were instituted on July 1, 2011. From July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012, 11 PICC infections were identified with 21,021 line days. The calculated infection rate was 0.52 per 1,000 line days. PICC infections so far have been reduced by 46%. CONCLUSION: By bridging the gap between inpatient and outpatient care, we reduced PICC infections by 46% in our home infusion patients. We accomplished this result through a collaborative partnership among hospital staff, an infusion company, and home health agencies and a standardized process for line care and maintenance using a PICC home care order set and a patient/nursing PICC care checklist.

24954426,2014,Are peripherally inserted central catheters associated with increased risk of adverse events in status 1B patients awaiting transplantation on continuous intravenous milrinone? ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are used to deliver continuous intravenous (IV) milrinone in stage D heart failure (HF) patients awaiting heart transplantation (HT). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed PICC adverse events (AEs) and associated cost in 129 status 1B patients from 2005 to 2012. End points were HT, left ventricular assist device (LVAD), and death. Regression analysis was used to identify AE risk factors. RESULTS: Fifty-three PICC AEs occurred in 35 patients (27%), consisting of 48 infections, 4 thromboses, and 1 bleeding event. Median duration of PICC support was 63 (interquartile range [IQR] 34-131) days, and median time to first PICC infection was 44 (IQR 14-76) days. Among PICC infections, 9% required defibrillator removal and 30% were inactivated on the HT list for a mean of 23 ± 17 days. Rate of HT, LVAD, or death was similar between groups (P > .05). Regression analysis found that a double lumen PICC was associated with a shorter time to first PICC infection (hazard ratio 7.59, 95% CI 1.97-29.23; P = .003). Median cost per PICC infection was $10,704 (IQR $7,401-$26,083). CONCLUSIONS: PICC infections were the most frequent AEs. PICCs with >1 lumen were associated with increased risk of infection. PICC AEs accounted for increased intensive care unit admissions, HT list inactivations, and overall cost.

METHODS: All patients treated from January 2010 to August 2012 at the Centre Henri Becquerel for early breast cancer requiring postoperative chemotherapy were retrospectively screened. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of a major complication related to the central venous catheter. Major complications were defined as any grade 3 event according to CTCAE 4.0, delay in chemotherapy >7 days, change of the device, life-threatening event, event requiring a hospitalization, or a prolongation of hospitalization. RESULTS: A total of 448 patients were included; 290 had a PC and 158 a PICC. Overall, 31 major complications related to the central venous catheter were observed: 13 for patients with a PC (4.5%) and 18 for patients with a PICC (11.4%). In univariate analysis, having a PICC was the only factor significantly associated with a higher risk of major complications (HR = 2.83, p = 0.0027). We observed a trend for a higher risk of major complications for patients older than 60 years or with BMI >25 (p = 0.06). In multivariate analysis, having a PICC was the only predictive factor of major complications (HR = 2.89, p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: In univariate and multivariate analysis, having a PICC instead of a PC was the only predictive factor of device-related major complication. If confirmed prospectively by the NCT02095743 ongoing trial, this result might modify the management of adjuvant chemotherapy administration.

A perspective within the Greek health system. ,"PURPOSE: We present a study comparing the insertion of central vascular catheter (CVC) and peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) by an anesthesia nurse at 2 Greek University Hospitals. METHODS: Eighty patients, aged 20-80 years, were enrolled in the study. Patients were divided into 2 groups. In group A (41 patients), a CVC was inserted in the internal jugular vein. In group B (39 patients), a pressure-injectable PICC was inserted in the basilica vein. RESULTS: Correlations between the methods applied, the patients' characteristics, the procedures' characteristics and the overall satisfaction scores for each procedure were examined. The final results show that the patients of group B (PICC method) were more satisfied with the procedure than the patients of group A (CVC method), at the statistical significance level of a=0.01. Also, according to the results of the analysis, the PICC method offers significantly more comfort and relative satisfaction than the CVC method, at the statistical significance level of a=0.01. The satisfaction scores of ""physicians"" were statistically more significant, at a=0.01, for the patients of group A (classic CVCs) mainly because of the insufficient flow rate of the PICCs when compared with the CVCs and especially if one considers the fact that the physicians did not have any experience with the PICC method at all. CONCLUSIONS: PICCs under ultrasound guidance constitute the solution of choice for patients and they definitely surpass the CVCs focusing mainly on the improvement of the quality of life and the satisfaction of patients.

23838218,2013,Impact of postplacement adjustment of peripherally inserted central catheters on the risk of bloodstream infection and venous thrombus formation. ,"OBJECTIVE: Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) tip malposition is potentially associated with complications, and postplacement adjustment of PICCs is widely performed. We sought to characterize the association between central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) or venous thrombus (VT) and PICC adjustment. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: University of Michigan Health System, a large referral hospital. PATIENTS: Patients who had PICCs placed between February 2007 and August 2007. METHODS: The primary outcomes were development of CLABSI within 14 days or VT within 60 days of postplacement PICC adjustment, identified by review of patient electronic medical records. RESULTS: There were 57 CLABSIs (2.69/1,000 PICC-days) and 47 VTs (1.23/1,000 PICC-days); 609 individuals had 1, 134 had 2, and 33 had 3 or more adjustments. One adjustment was protective against CLABSI (P=.04), whereas 2 or 3 or more adjustments had no association with CLABSI (P=.58 and .47, respectively). One, 2, and 3 or more adjustments had no association with VT formation (P=.59, .85, and .78, respectively). Immunosuppression (P<.01), power-injectable PICCs (P=.05), and 3 PICC lumens compared with 1 lumen (P=.02) were associated with CLABSI. Power-injectable PICCs were also associated with increased VT formation (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: Immunosuppression and 3 PICC lumens were associated with increased risk of CLABSI. Power-injectable PICCs were associated with increased risk of CLABSI and VT formation. Postplacement adjustment of PICCs was not associated with increased risk of CLABSI or VT.

27642604,2016,A Novel Two-Step Technique for Retrieving Fractured Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter Segments Migrating into the Heart or the Pulmonary Artery. ,"Objective. To report the experience of a percutaneous technique for retrieving fractured peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) segments migrating into the heart or the pulmonary artery. Method. From April 2013 to July 2015, we performed percutaneous retrieval of fractured PICC segments migrating into the heart or the pulmonary artery in five cancer patients who had undergone chemotherapy via PICC. The fractures were diagnosed with chest plain radiography. The patients included three cases of breast cancer, one case of rectal cancer, and one case of lower limb Ewing's tumor. The fractures were retained in the vessels of the patients for 1 to 3 days. All the fractures were retrieved by using a novel two-step technique in the digital subtraction angiography (DSA) suite. This two-step technique involves inserting a pigtail catheter to the heart or the pulmonary artery to grasp the fractured catheter fragment and bring it to the lower segment of the inferior vena cava, followed by grasping and removing the catheter fragment with a retrieval loop system of the vena cava filter retrieval set. Result. The fractured PICC segments were removed successfully in all five patients via unilateral (four patients) or bilateral (one patient) femoral vein access. No complications occurred during the interventional procedure. Conclusion. Percutaneous retrieval can be a safe, convenient, and minimally invasive method for the removal of fractured PICC segments. The technique reported in this paper will be applicable for the retrieval of fractured PICC segments and other catheter fragments migrating into the heart or the pulmonary artery.

26045668,2015,The incidence and risk factors of peripherally inserted central catheter-related infection among cancer patients. ,"BACKGROUND: As the use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) increased in chemotherapy, the identification of complications and risk factors became essential to prevent patient harm. But little is known about PICC-related infection and risk factors among patients with cancer. Our study was to identify the prevalence, patterns, and risk factors of catheter-related infections associated with PICCs. METHODS: A 3-year prospective cohort study was conducted in a university-affiliated hospital. All patients with cancer who met inclusion criteria were enrolled. The patients were followed up until catheter removal. Tip cultures were routinely performed at the time of catheter removal. The general information was recorded at the time of PICC insertion, weekly care, and removal. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied for identification of risk factors. RESULTS: In total, 912 cancer patients with 912 PICCs of 96,307 catheter days were enrolled. Ninety-four developed PICC-related infection; 46 were exit-site infection, 43 were catheter bacterial colonization, and five were PICC-related bloodstream infection. The median time from catheter insertion to infection was 98.26 days. Multivariate analysis showed StatLock fixing (odds ratio [OR] =0.555, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.326-0.945) and tip position located in the lower one-third of the superior vena cava (OR =0.340, 95% CI: 0.202-0.571) were associated with lower PICC infection rate. Catheter care delay (OR =2.612, 95% CI: 1.373-4.969) and indwelling mostly in summer (OR =4.784, 95% CI: 2.681-8.538) were associated with higher infection incidence. CONCLUSION: StatLock fixing and tip position located in the lower one-third of the superior vena cava were protective factors against PICC-related infection, while catheter care delay and indwelling mostly in summer were risk factors. Policy and measures targeting these factors may be necessary to reduce the risk of infection. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],[],"['PICC' 'catheter-related bloodstream infection' 'clinical study'

24005884,2014,Comparison of peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICC) versus subcutaneously implanted port-chamber catheters by complication and cost for patients receiving chemotherapy for non-haematological malignancies. ,"PURPOSE: Indwelling central venous catheters (CVCs) have been increasingly used to enable delivery of intravenous chemotherapy. We aimed to compare the safety and cost of two commonly used CVCs, peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICCs) and ports, in the delivery of chemotherapy in patients with non-haematological malignancies. METHODS: Seventy patients were randomly assigned to receive either a PICC or a port. The primary endpoint was occurrence of major complications, which required removal of the CVC and secondary endpoints included occurrence of any complications. RESULTS: Port devices were associated with fewer complications compared with PICC lines (hazard ratio of 0.25, CI, 0.09-0.86, P = 0.038). Major complication rate was lower in the port arm compared to the PICC arm (0.047 versus 0.193 major complications/100 catheter days, P = 0.034) with 6 versus 20 % of patients experiencing major complications, respectively. Thrombosis, the most common complication, was significantly higher in the PICC arm compared to the port arm (25 versus 0 %, P = 0.013). Quality of life and cost estimates did not differ significantly between the two arms. CONCLUSIONS: Port devices are associated with a lower risk of complications, with no difference in cost, compared to PICC lines in patients with non-haematological malignancies receiving intravenous chemotherapy.

32664112,2020,Prognostic factors for venous thrombosis in patients with peripherally inserted central catheters: Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) has become increasingly popular in clinical practice because of the ease and safety of insertion and lower cost-effectiveness. The precise incidence and risk of PICC-related venous thrombosis is important to be verified in the context of growing PICC use and an understanding of the risk of venous thrombosis is an important cost and patient safety question. METHOD: We will search seven electronic databases including the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Chinese BioMedical Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese VIP and Wangfang Database regardless of publication date or language. All studies with prognostic factor analysis will be included if they recruited participants with PICC. Primary outcomes will include venous thrombosis. The risk of bias will be assessed by 2 authors using quality in prognostic studies tool. If possible, a meta-analysis in fixed or random effects model will be conducted by R-3.5.1 software, otherwise a narrative synthesis will ensue focusing on prognostic factors. The confidence in cumulative evidence will be assessed by Based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. RESULTS: The aim of this study is to retrieve, appraise and summarize the clinical evidence of risk assessment for PICC-related venous thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: This study will assess the precise incidence and risk of venous thrombosis in patients with PICC and provide references for establishing relevant assessment tools. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is a protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis of prognostic factors for venous thrombosis in PICC patients.

27895356,2016,The power peripherally inserted central catheter is superior to a central venous catheter in management of patients with esophageal variceal bleeding undergoing devascularization. ,"Peripherally-inserted central catheters (PICC) have a greater retention time and less complications compared to central venous catheters (CVC). The study was conducted from From January of 2014 to December 2015 at Beijing DiTan Hospital, Beijing, China, and comprised 70 patients undergoing devascularisation. Of the total, 36(51.4%) patients underwent placement of PICC (Group A), while 34(48.6%) underwent had CVC (Group B). Venous catheterisation was successful in all patients. The median duration of venous catheterization in Group A was greater than that in Group B (p=0.002). Catheter-associated complications did not differ between the groups (p=0.46). The level of blood platelet (PLT) count, Prothrombin activity (PTA) and white blood cell (WBC) count before venous catheterisation were independent risk factors for bleeding at the puncture site and catheter-related infections. A Power PICC may be a better choice than a CVC in patients undergoing devascularisation requiring catheterisation. For patients with a lower PLT count, a decreased PTA, or a decreased WBC, venous catheterisation should be performed with caution.

36109819,2022,Subcutaneous tunnelling versus conventional insertion of peripherally inserted central catheters in hospitalized patients (TUNNEL-PICC): a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are now widely used in modern medicine, and associated complications have also increased. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) is the most serious complication because it can cause extended hospital stays and increase costs. Furthermore, it can contribute to dire consequences for critically ill patients. Subcutaneous tunnelling for central venous catheters is an accepted method to reduce the risk of CLABSI. However, it is not generally adopted for PICC placement in most hospitals because its safety and efficacy have not been thoroughly evaluated. METHODS: In this multi-institutional, prospective, non-blinded pragmatic randomized controlled trial, 1694 patients treated at five referral hospitals will be assigned to one of two parallel arms (conventional and tunnelled PICC groups) using computer-generated stratified randomization. The conventional group will undergo PICC placement by routine practice. In the tunnelled PICC (tPICC) group, additional subcutaneous tunnelling will be applied. Patients will be followed until PICC removal or the end of this study. The primary endpoint is whether subcutaneous tunnelling reduced the rate of CLABSI compared to the conventional method. The secondary endpoints are technical success rates, complications including exit-site bleeding or infection, and the procedure time between the groups. DISCUSSION: Subcutaneous tunnelling is a widely used method to reduce catheter-associated infection. However, it has not been thoroughly applied for PICC. A randomized trial is needed to objectively assess the effects of the subcutaneous tunnel in PICC placement. This TUNNEL-PICC trial will provide evidence for the effectiveness of subcutaneous tunnelling in decreasing the risk of CLABSI.

31970514,2020,Peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) in outpatient and inpatient oncological treatment. ,"PURPOSE: So far there is little evidence on peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) in radiation oncology patients maintaining the access during the periods of ambulatory and hospital treatment. METHODS: A total of 522 PICC placements in 484 patients were performed between 11/2011 and 07/2016 at the Department of Radiation Oncology and analysed retrospectively for complications and treatment- and patient-related factors during ambulatory and hospital inpatient use. On initial hospitalization, all patients received a multimodal radio-oncological treatment consisting of radiation and intravenous therapy administered via the PICC. RESULTS: A total of 18,292 catheter days were documented. Median follow-up from catheter insertion to their removal was 37 days (1-97). The overall complication rate was 4.1 per 1000 catheter days (n = 75, 14.4%). Complications were similar between the cohort of outpatient 3.6 per 1000 catheter days and the cohort of inpatient 4.8 per 1000 catheter days (OR 0.976; 95% CI [0.598; 1.619]; p = 0.924). Severe bloodstream infections occurred at a rate of 0.60 per 1000 catheter days (n = 11, 2.1%), deep vein thrombosis at a rate of 0.82 per 1.000 catheter days (n = 15, 2.9%) and local inflammation at a rate of 1.26 per 1.000 catheter days (n = 23, 4.4%). Only immunotherapy could be identified as an independent risk factor for complications (OR 5.6; 95% CI [2.4; 13.1]; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Using PICC in outpatients is not associated with an elevated risk of complications. Particular attention should be payed to early identification of PICC associated bloodstream infections. Immunotherapy is an independent risk factor for local skin complication. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Adolescent' 'Adult' 'Aged'

30704933,2019,A Frontline Approach With Peripherally Inserted Versus Centrally Inserted Central Venous Catheters for Remission Induction Chemotherapy Phase of Acute Myeloid Leukemia: A Randomized Comparison. ,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)-related adverse events has been uncertain in the setting of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) compared with the incidence of centrally inserted central catheter (CICC) adverse events. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a monocentric, randomized trial of patients with previously untreated AML. Of the 93 patients, 46 had received a PICC and 47 had received a CICC as frontline intravascular device. Thereafter, all patients underwent intensive chemotherapy for hematologic remission induction. The primary endpoint was catheter-related (CR)-bloodstream infection (BSI) and venous thrombosis (VT) rate. The secondary endpoints catheter malfunction, catheter removal, and patient overall survival. RESULTS: The CR-BSI and CR-VT rate in the PICC and CICC groups was 13% and 49%, respectively, with a difference of 36 percentage points (relative risk for CR-BSI or CR-VT, 0.266; P = .0003). The CR-BSI incidence was 1.4 and 7.8 per 1000 catheters daily in the PICC and CICC groups, respectively. Among the CR thromboses, the symptomatic VT rate was 2.1% in the PICC group and 10.6% in the CICC group. In the CICC group, 16 of the 47 patients (34%) had the catheter removed for BSI (n = 5), septic thrombophlebitis (n = 4), VT (n = 2), or malfunction (n = 5) a median of 7 days after insertion. In the PICC group, only 6 of the 46 patients (13%) required catheter removal for VT (n = 2) or malfunction (n = 4). At a median follow-up of 30 days, 6 patients in the CICC group died of CR complications versus none of the patients in the PICC group (P = .012). Using PICCs, the reduction in BSI and symptomatic VT decreased mortality from CR infection and venous thromboembolism. In contrast, the CICC approach led to early catheter removal mostly for difficult-to-treat infectious pathogens. CONCLUSION: Our data have confirmed that BSI and symptomatic VT are the major complications affecting frontline central intravascular device-related morbidity in the leukemia setting. The use of a PICC is safer than that of a CICC and maintains the effectiveness for patients with AML undergoing chemotherapy, with an approximate fourfold lower combined risk of infection or thrombosis at 30 days.

34432170,2022,A model to assess the risk of peripherally inserted central venous catheter-related thrombosis in patients with breast cancer: a retrospective cohort study. ,"PURPOSE: Limited risk assessment tool to stratify the risk of PICC-related thrombosis (PICC-RVT) in breast cancer patients. This study developed a model to assess the risk of PICC-RVT in breast cancer patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1284 breast cancer patients receiving PICC insertion from January 1, 2015, to August 31, 2019, at a cancer specialized hospital in Hunan province, China. The entire population was divided into two groups at a ratio of 3:1 which included a derivation sample (n = 978), and a validation sample (n = 284). PICC-RVT was confirmed by ultrasonography in the presence of clinical symptoms and signs. RESULTS: PICC-RVT occurred in 40 (4.09%) of the derivation sample patients. Multivariable analysis identified 9 variables: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, prior central venous catheter placement, higher level of platelets, higher level of D-dimer, lower level of activated partial thromboplastin time, menopause, no prior breast surgery, upper extremity lymphedema, and endocrine therapy. Points were assigned to each variable according to regression coefficient. The model had an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.850 (95% CI 0.776 to 0.924), The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit was 5.780 (p = 0.328). At a cutoff value of 3.5, the sensitivity and specificity were 75% and 83%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Several disease-specific factors of breast cancer (e.g., menopause, endocrine therapy, and upper extremity lymphedema) play important roles in the development of PICC-RVT. Patients at higher PICC-RVT risk could be candidates for close post-insertion monitoring and interventions to prevent PICC-RVT. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['*Breast Neoplasms/therapy'

27542955,2016,"Incidence of catheter-related thrombosis in acute leukemia patients: a comparative, retrospective study of the safety of peripherally inserted vs. centrally inserted central venous catheters. ","Central venous catheters are a leading cause of upper-extremity deep vein thrombosis. Concomitant severe thrombocytopenia makes anticoagulation for catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) in patients with acute leukemia (AL) a challenge. Incidence of CRT has been reported to be increased in those with peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) vs. those with centrally inserted ones (CICC). Our objective is to compare the incidence rate of CRT in leukemia inpatients who received either a PICC vs. CICC. We retrospectively reviewed adult inpatients admitted to hematology wards with a new diagnosis of AL and who received either a PICC or a CICC. Baseline patient and catheter characteristics were recorded. Our primary outcome was the incidence rate of CRT in each group. The secondary outcomes included rates of infectious and mechanical complications. Six hundred sixty-three patients received at least one PICC (338) or CICC (325) insertion. A total of 1331 insertions were recorded, with 82 (11.7 %) and 41 (6.5 %) CRT in the PICC and CICC groups, respectively. The incidence rates were 1.89 and 0.52 per 1000 catheter day in the PICC and CICC groups, respectively. A PICC, when compared to CICC, was a significant risk factor for CRT (sHR 2.5, p < 0.0001). The prevalence and incidence rates of CRT in our AL patients were higher than predicted for a general cancer patient population. These rates were higher in the PICC group compared to the CICC group. We recommend careful consideration of thrombotic and bleeding risks of AL inpatients when choosing a central venous catheter.

This study investigates PICC failures in cancer patients. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted at a single cancer institution on 291 PICC placement for chemotherapy. The primary study outcome was PICC failure. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 119 days. PICC complications occurred in 72 patients (24.7%) and failures with removal in 44 (15.1%). Reasons for failures were upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (UEDVT) 12 (4.1%), central line associate bloodstream infection (CLABSI) 5 (1.7%) with an infection rate of 0.95 per 1,000 catheter days, exit site infection 9 (3.1%) with a rate of 1.46 per 1,000 catheter days, catheter dislodgment 11 (3.8%), and occlusion 7 (2.4%). Statistically significant risk factors were previous DVT (HR 2.95, 95%CI 1.33-6.53), reason for PICC implant (HR 3.65, 95%CI 1.12-10.34) and 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab based chemotherapy (HR 3.11, 95%CI 1.17-8.26). CONCLUSIONS: PICC is a safe venous device for chemotherapy delivery. Nevertheless, a 15% rate of failure has to be taken in account when planning PICC insertion for chemotherapy purposes. J. Surg.

35034480,2022,A multicenter retrospective study on 4480 implanted PICC-ports: A GAVeCeLT project. ,"BACKGROUND: PICC-ports may be defined as totally implantable central venous devices inserted in the upper limb using the current state-of-the-art techniques of PICC insertion (ultrasound-guided venipuncture of deep veins of the arm, micro-puncture kits, proper location of the tip preferably by intracavitary ECG), with placement of the reservoir at the middle third of the arm. A previous report on breast cancer patients demonstrated the safety and efficacy of these devices, with a very low failure rate. METHODS: This retrospective multicenter cohort study-developed by GAVeCeLT (the Italian Group of Long-Term Venous Access Devices)-investigated the outcomes of PICC-ports in a large cohort of unselected patients. The study included 4480 adult patients who underwent PICC-port insertion in five Italian centers, during a period of 60 months. The primary outcome was device failure, defined as any serious adverse event (SAE) requiring removal. The secondary outcome was the incidence of temporary adverse events (TAE) not requiring removal. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 15.5 months. Device failure occurred in 52 cases (1.2%), the main causes being local infection (n = 7; 0.16%) and CRBSI (n = 19; 0.42%). Symptomatic catheter-related thrombosis occurred in 93 cases (2.1%), but removal was required only in one case (0.02%). Early/immediate and late TAE occurred in 904 cases (20.2%) and in 176 cases (3.9%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: PICC-ports are safe venous access devices that should be considered as an alternative option to traditional arm-ports and chest-ports when planning chemotherapy or other long-term intermittent intravenous treatments.

37052429,2023,Promoting appropriate midline catheter and PICC placement through implementation of an EHR-based clinical decision support tool: An interrupted time-series analysis. ,"BACKGROUND: Inappropriate use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), including multilumen PICCs, may increase the risk of patient complications. OBJECTIVE: Implement computerized decision support to: (a) increase the use of midline catheters over PICCs when appropriate and (b) decrease PICC lumens when a PICC is necessary. DESIGNS: Quasi-experimental, interrupted time series. SETTING: Single tertiary academic medical center. PATIENTS: Hospitalized adults who received a midline or PICC during clinical care. INTERVENTION: Decision support on appropriate vascular access device choice via a set of electronic orders embedded within the electronic health record. MEASUREMENTS: Proportion of midline catheter and single-lumen PICCs placed between January 2, 2017 and November 19, 2017 (preintervention) versus November 20, 2017 to December 1, 2019 (postintervention). RESULTS: A total of 8758 midline and PICCs were inserted during the study period. A statistically significant increase in the insertion of midline catheters was observed during the intervention (p = .006). In parallel, single-lumen PICC insertion as a proportion of all PICCs also increased after the intervention (p = .035). Results were consistent across multiple disciplines, including internal medicine, surgery, and intensive care. After considering the hospital census, total PICC and midline utilization rates and rates of complications did not change over time. However, an increase in catheter exchanges from less to more invasive devices occurred. CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center study, the implementation of electronic decision support to inform appropriate catheter use led to a more appropriate midline catheter and single-lumen PICC insertion. Dissemination of this single, effective intervention to examine efficacy in other hospital settings would be welcomed.

24980559,2014,A single institution experience of seven hundred consecutively placed peripherally inserted central venous catheters. ,"INTRODUCTION: Peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) are being increasingly placed at the bedside by trained vascular access professional such as nurses. This is to increase the availability of the service, for cost containment, and to reduce the workload on the interventional radiologist. We describe a single institution experience with over 700 PICC lines placed by trained nurses at the bedside and determine the success rate, malposition rate of the PICC line , degree of support needed from the Interventional radiologist, and factors affecting a successful placement of a PICC line by the nurses. METHODS: Seven hundred and five PICC lines were placed at the South Nassau Communities hospital between July 2011 and November 2012 by trained vascular access nurses with interventional radiology backup. Bedside ultrasound was used for venous access, an electromagnetic catheter tip detection device was used to navigate the catheter into the desired central vein and catheter tip position was confirmed using a portable bedside chest X-ray. RESULTS: The nurses, with a malposition rate of 3.8%, successfully placed 91.6% (646/705) catheters. Interventional radiology support was needed for 59 cases (8.4%) and 17 cases (2.4%) for failed placement and catheter malposition adjustment, respectively. Risk factor such as presence of pacemaker wires and multiple attempts at insertion were factors predictive of an unsuccessful placement of a PICC line by the nurses. CONCLUSIONS: Bedside placement of PICC line by trained vascular nurses is an effective method with a high success rate, low malposition rate and requires minimal support from interventional radiology.

24344480,2013,Periphally inserted central catheters- a 'serious' complication. ,"Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placement in the upper arm appears to have led to an increased incidence of the inadvertent puncture of lymph vessels, which transport lymph fluid around the body. The fluid flows from the lymph vessel in the arm, through the subcutaneous tract created by the PICC, accumulating in discharge of serous fluid at the exit site. The symptoms may be minimal or excessive and currently there are no published data or guidance as to how to manage this complication. Possible management strategies are proposed in this article. They involve the assessment of the amount and persistence of the discharge, with removal indicated when symptoms persist or when the volume is excessive.

33893843,2021,Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 gene promoter 4G/5G polymorphism and risks of peripherally inserted central catheter-related venous thrombosis in patients with lung cancer: a prospective cohort study. ,"PURPOSE: This study investigated the influence of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene polymorphisms and other contributing clinical factors on peripherally inserted central catheter-related venous thrombosis (PICC-RVT) in Chinese patients with lung cancer. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 237 participants. Blood samples were collected to detect the PAI-1 4G/5G genotype. Venous thromboembolism risk was calculated by the Caprini risk assessment model. Color Doppler ultrasonography was performed every 7 days for 3 weeks to confirm PICC-RVT. RESULTS: The rate of PICC-RVT was 13.50% (32/237). The 5G/5G, 4G/5G, and 4G/4G genotypes were found in 12.50% vs 17.56%, 59.38% vs 49.27%, and 28.12% vs 34.17% in the thrombus group and the non-thrombus group of the participants. No difference was observed in the distribution frequency of the three genotypes between the thrombus and non-thrombus groups. A higher fibrinogen level (OR 1.194, 95% CI 1.004-1.420, P = 0.045) and a higher Caprini score (OR 1.698, 95% CI 1.103-2.614, P = 0.016) were statistically significant risk factors for PICC-RVT. Compared with patients who underwent a pemetrexed/cisplatin regimen, those who were administered paclitaxel/cisplatin (OR 18.332, 95% CI 2.890-116.278, P = 0.002) or gemcitabine/cisplatin (OR 6.617, 95% CI 1.210-36.180, P = 0.029) were at increased risk of PICC-RVT. CONCLUSION: Our finding suggested that there is no statistically significant influence of the PAI-1 4G/5G gene variant on PICC-RVT in Chinese patients with lung cancer. However, patients with higher Caprini scores and higher fibrinogen levels are at increased risk for PICC-RVT, as are patients receiving chemotherapy. Clinical staff should carefully perform a risk assessment for patients with PICC. Those with the above risk factors should pay close attention and take timely and effective preventive measures.

34812074,2023,The use of peripherally inserted central catheter reduced the incidence of phlebitis in heart failure patients: A randomized trial. ,"BACKGROUND: During decompensated heart failure, the use of intravenous inotropes can be necessary. With peripheral venous access, prolonged inotrope infusion can cause phlebitis. However, traditional central venous catheters have possible complications. Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) may be an alternative to traditional catheters. AIM: Our objective was to compare the incidence of phlebitis between patients with PICC and those with peripheral venous access catheter indwelling. METHODS: In a randomized clinical trial, the patients were randomized to PICC and control groups, with 40 patients in each group. The inclusion criteria were hospitalized patients with advanced heart failure, ejection fraction of <0.45, and platelet count of >50,000/mm(3) and current use of continuous intravenous infusion of dobutamine. The patients were randomly assigned to receive a PICC or keep their peripheral venous access. The primary end point was the occurrence of phlebitis. RESULTS: The PICC and control groups included 40 patients each. The median age was 61.5 years; ejection fraction, 0.24; and dobutamine dose, 7.73 µg/(kg min). Phlebitis occurred in 1 patient (2.5%) in the PICC group and in 38 patients (95.0%) in the control group, with an odds ratio of 0.10% (95% confidence interval: 0.01%-1.60%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, in severe heart failure patients who received intravenous dobutamine, PICC use reduced the incidence of phlebitis when compared to patients with peripheral venous access. Therefore, the PICC use should considered over peripheral venous access for prolonged intravenous therapy in heart failure patients.

31591954,2019,Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions associated with the insertion of peripherally inserted central catheters: A multiyear comparative retrospective cohort study. ,"OBJECTIVE: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are a mainstay of nonpermanent vascular access devices. In this study, we assessed patients displaying anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions to the PowerPICC SOLO and Groshong PICC (Bard Access Systems) using the Sherlock tip locating system (TLS). METHODS: Patients from 2 tertiary-care hospitals were systematically monitored over 4 years for adverse events following the insertion of a PICC using the Sherlock TLS. Insertion data were also collected using the BioFlo PICC (Angiodynamics)from a third hospital site and from The Ottawa Hospital over 4 years as an additional comparator. Three definitions of anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions were utilized, and the Cohen κ was used to assess interrater agreement. Analysis of reactions among the patient cohorts was performed using the χ2 test with Yates correction or the Fisher exact test as appropriate. RESULTS: Among 8,257 insertions using the TLS PICCs, 37 potential reactions (0.45%) were recorded. Using specific definitions for anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions, 54.1%-91.9% met criteria. Comparator populations using data from Calgary (n = 491) and Ottawa (n = 7,889) using the BioFlo PICC insertion found no reactions. Anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions were significantly associated with the PowerPICC SOLO and Groshong PICC with the TLS compared to the BioFlo PICC (P < .0001) across all definitions. The largest subset of patients experiencing adverse reactions had cystic fibrosis (CF) (n = 4, 10.8%). CONCLUSION: Our study results demonstrate significant adverse events associated with the PowerPICC SOLO and Groshong PICC using the Sherlock TLS inserted across a range of patient populations. The incidence rate of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions in the CF population at our center is significantly higher than in non-CF patients (P < .001).

34673343,2021,Complications associated with peripherally inserted central catheters and Hickman™ in patients with advanced pulmonary hypertension treated with intravenous prostanoids. ,"BACKGROUND: Epoprostenol requires continuous infusion and may lead to catheter-related complications. Evidence regarding the comparison between peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) or tunneled central catheters in Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is scarce. We sought to study the incidence of mechanical and infectious complications associated with PICC and Hickman catheters in patients with PH under epoprostenol treatment. METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective study of patients with PH who received continuous treatment with intravenous epoprostenol for at least 24 h between January 2010 and July 2020. Mechanical and infectious complications were analyzed according to the catheter type: PICC and Hickman. The incidence of catheter-related complications was calculated per 1000 exposure-days of risk. RESULTS: 175 catheters were implanted in 109 patients, of which 100 (57.1%) were Hickman and 75 (42.9%) were PICC. After a median follow-up of 334 [130-798] days, there were no differences in the rates of local (0.22 vs 0.21; p = 0.904) or blood-stream infections (0.13 vs 0.21; p = 0.405). Mechanical complications were more frequent in the PICC group (0.98 vs 0.23 p=<0.001), including venous thrombosis (0.16 vs 0.00 p = 0.003) and catheter occlusion (0.66 vs 0.04 p=<0.001). These complications were associated with a greater need for hospitalization (1.48 vs 0.50; p=<0.001), without differences in mortality during follow-up (0.33 vs 0.21; p = 0.288). CONCLUSION: In patients with PH treated with intravenous epoprostenol, both Hickman and PICC catheters were associated with high rate of complications. Although there were no differences in the frequency of infectious-related complications, PICC was associated with a higher frequency of catheter occlusion and deep venous thrombosis.

32762225,2020,The role of sterile chitosan-based dressing in reducing complications related to a peripherally inserted central catheter in patients with hematological tumors. ,"BACKGROUND: Intravenous chemotherapy is one of the most common treatments for hematological tumors, a major threat to human health and life. Due to its safety, comfort, and convenience, a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) is the preferred route of administration of intravenous chemotherapy. However, some PICC-related complications are drawing increasing attention. In this study, we investigated the use and role of sterile chitosan-based dressing in PICC-related complications in patients with hematological tumors. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 205 patients with hematological tumors who had a PICC placed. The patients were divided into two groups, the observation group (sterile chitosan-based dressing, n=105) and the control group (sterile gauze dressing; n=100). The incidences of bleeding, infection, poor healing, and phlebitis, as well as the risk of bleeding, infection, and poor healing at the puncture site within a week of PICC placement, were analyzed. RESULTS: The overall incidences of bleeding, infection, and poor healing were, respectively, 42.9%, 6.7%, and 6.7% in the observation group and 63.0%, 22.0%, and 34% in the control group (all P<0.05). The risk of local bleeding was significantly lower in the observation group than in the control group [odds ratio (OR) 0.366; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.211-0.634; P<0.001]. The risk of local bleeding was significantly higher in the platelets <50×109/L group than in the platelets >100×109/L group (OR 3.068; 95% CI: 1.397-6.740; P=0.005), while no significant difference was observed in the risk of bleeding between the platelets 50×109-100×109/L group and the platelets >100×109/L group (OR 0.839; 95% CI: 0.404-1.742; P=0.638). The risk of infection (OR 0.214; 95% CI: 0.088-0.522; P<0.001) and the risk of poor healing (OR 0.139; 95% CI: 0.058-0.331; P<0.001) were significantly lower in the observation group than in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with hematological tumors, sterile chitosan-based dressing after PICC placement reduces the risk of bleeding and infection and promotes healing at the puncture site.

36726149,2023,Efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban for the treatment of PICC-related upper extremity deep vein thrombosis in cancer patients: a retrospective study. ,"BACKGROUND: The optimal duration and choice of anticoagulant for the treatment of Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC)-related upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT) in cancer patients are still undetermined. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban for the treatment of PICC-related UEDVT in cancer patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including consecutive cancer patients for the management of acute symptomatic PICC-related UEDVT. The efficacy outcome of the study was the 180-day recurrence of any venous thromboembolism (VTE), while the safety outcome was the 180-day incidence of all bleeding events. The Kaplan‒Meier method was used to estimate the overall incidence. Hazard ratios (HRs) were obtained with a Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the risk of the outcome events. RESULTS: A total of 217 patients were included in the final analysis with a median age of 56 years old, 41.5% of whom had metastases. After the initial 3-5 days of nadroparin, patients received sequential anticoagulation, either with nadroparin (118 patients) or with rivaroxaban (99 patients). Four patients with recurrent VTE were observed (nadroparin, n = 2; rivaroxaban, n = 2). The 180-day cumulative VTE recurrence rates were 1.7% and 2.0% (p = 0.777) in patients receiving nadroparin and rivaroxaban, respectively. The overall bleeding rate at 180 days was 8.8%. Although no major bleeding events were observed, nineteen patients with clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (CRNMB) were observed. The 180-day cumulative rate of CRNMB was 5.1% for nadroparin and 13.1% for rivaroxaban (HR = 3.303, 95% CI 1.149-9.497, p = 0.027). CONCLUSION: Our study supported the efficacy of rivaroxaban for treating PICC-related UEDVT in cancer patients. However, data on anticoagulation therapy for PICC-related UEDVT presented with a low risk of VTE recurrence and a relatively high risk of CRNMB bleeding events. Considering the risk-benefit ratio, further well-designed trials are required to optimize the drug selection and duration for the treatment of PICC-related UEDVT in cancer patients.

24018351,2014,"A randomised, controlled trial comparing the long-term effects of peripherally inserted central catheter placement in chemotherapy patients using B-mode ultrasound with modified Seldinger technique versus blind puncture. ","OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) placement using B-mode ultrasound with the modified Seldinger technique (BUMST) versus the blind puncture. METHODS: One hundred chemotherapy patients were recruited to participate in a randomised, controlled trial in Guangzhou, China. Fifty were assigned to the experimental group (using BUMST), and 50 were assigned to the control group (blind puncture). Demographic and background data, data related to PICC placement, complications after PICC placement, the patients' degree of comfort (determined via a questionnaire), and patients' costs for PICC maintenance were collected to compare the effects of the two methods. T-tests and chi-square tests were used to analyse the data; p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. RESULTS: Nighty-eight of the 100 PICCs were successfully inserted (50 in the experimental group and 48 in the control group). Compared with the control group, the experimental group had a lower rate of unplanned catheter removal (4.0% vs. 18.7%; p = 0.02), a lower incidence of mechanical phlebitis (0% vs. 22.9%; p < 0.001), a lower incidence of venous thrombosis (0% vs. 8.3%; p = 0.037), and a higher incidence of catheter migration (32% vs. 2.1%; p < 0.001). Compared with the control group, the experimental group experienced significantly less severe contact dermatitis (p = 0.038), had improved comfort at 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months after PICC placement (p < 0.001), and had lower costs for PICC maintenance at 2 months, 3 months and when the catheter was removed (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Using B-mode ultrasound with MST for PICC placement reduced complications and patients' costs for PICC maintenance and improved patients' degree of comfort; thus, this procedure should be more widely used.

The use of ultrasound is recommended at all stages of introduction. Precise tip placement of the central catheter in the sinoatrial junction region further reduces the number of thromboses arising in the catheter. A trend towards the treatment of catheter infections is certainly to maintain the venous access without compromising the patients health.

To predict the risk factors of thrombosis. To validate the best predictive model in predicting PICC associated thrombosis. Consecutive oncology cases in 341 who initially naive intended to be inserted central catheter for chemotherapy, were recruited to our dedicated intravenous lab. All patients used the same gauge catheter, Primary endpoint was thrombosis formation, the secondary endpoint was infusion termination without thrombosis. Two patients were excluded. 339 patients were divided into thrombosis group in 59 (17.4%) and non-thrombosis Group in 280 (82.6%), retrospectively. Tumor, Sex, Age, Weight, Height, BMI, BSA, PS, WBC, BPC, PT, D-dimer, APTT, FIB, Smoking history, Location, Catheter length, Ratio and Number as independent variables were analyzed by Fisher's scoring, then Logistic risk regression, ROC analysis and nomogram was introduced.

RESULTS: Nine hundred and twenty-three PICCs were placed in 644 unique patients, mostly male (68.3%) with a median age of 58 years. 31 (3.4%) PICC-related infections occurred during the study period corresponding to an infection rate of 1.64 per 1000 catheter-days. We observed 27 (87.1%) CR-BSI, corresponding to a rate of 1.43 per 1000 catheter-days, 3 (9.7%) septic thrombophlebitis, and 1 (3.2%) exit-site infection. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a higher PICC-related infection rate with chemotherapy (odds ratio (OR) 7.2-confidence interval (CI) 95% [1.77-29.5]), auto/allograft (OR 5.9-CI 95% [1.2-29.2]), and anti-coagulant therapy (OR 2.2-95% [1.4-12]). CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy, auto/allograft, and anti-coagulant therapy are associated with an increased risk of developing PICC-related infections. CLINICAL ADVANCE: Chemotherapy, auto/allograft, and anti-coagulant therapy are important predictors of PICC-associated infections. A careful assessment of these risk factors may be important for future success in preventing PICC-related infections. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Adolescent' 'Adult' 'Aged' 'Aged, 80 and over'

34108612,2021,Catheter-related bloodstream infection associated with multiple insertions of the peripherally inserted central catheter in patients with hematological disorders. ,"Patients with hematological disorders are treated with multiple cycles of chemotherapy. As a result, they often require multiple insertions of the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) for prolonged periods of time. Although PICCs have been widely used worldwide in various patients, the safety and feasibility of the multiple insertions of the PICC in this population have not been fully verified. We performed a retrospective analysis to clarify the relationship between complications and multiple PICC insertions in patients with hematological disorders who were treated with either chemotherapy or immunotherapy. A total of 651 PICCs were inserted in 261 patients with a median age of 66 years. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were the most common diseases in our patient cohort. The total catheter days (CDs) was 29,485 days, with a median catheter duration of 30 days. The rate of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) in our patient cohort at high rate of re-insertion was 2.0/1000 CDs. Although multiple PICC insertions were not a risk factor of CRBSI, our findings suggest that a prolonged catheter dwell time may be associated with CRBSI. AML was an important risk factor of CRBSI. While the PICC dwell time depends on the treatment cycle, our findings indicate that it should be limited to approximately 30 days and catheters may be removed and re-inserted as needed.

30180989,2019,Peripherally inserted central catheter-associated bloodstream infection: Risk factors and the role of antibiotic-impregnated catheters for prevention. ,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial-impregnated (AIP) peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) may lower risk of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) compared with nonantimicrobial-impregnated (NAIP) catheters. We sought to assess risk factors for CLABSI with a focus on the effect of AIP PICCs. METHODS: CLABSI rate was determined among patients who received PICCs from July 2009 through June 2012 using a retrospective study design. A nested case-control study matched for operators (interventional radiology [IR], infectious diseases [IDs], and the nurse venous access team [VAT]) was conducted to assess risks for PICC CLABSI. RESULTS: Eighty-nine PICC CLABSIs (1.66%) occurred among 5,372 PICC placements a mean of 32 days after placement. Higher infection risk (1.75) was observed for IR-placed PICCs compared with ID-placed PICCs (P = .02). In addition, higher infection risk (4.22) was observed for IR-placed PICCS compared with VAT-placed PICCs (P = .0008). IR-placed NAIP catheters, as indicated by multivariate analysis, revealed a 5.45-fold greater CLABSI risk compared with AIP catheters (P < .0005). Other risk factors included chemotherapy, placement of a tunneled catheter, leukemia, and AIDS. CONCLUSIONS: PICC CLABSIs were highest among patients receiving NAIP catheters in this large study. Highest risk occurred with placement of a tunneled catheter, AIDS, leukemia, and if the indication for PICC was chemotherapy. Our study suggests that the AIP PICC should be considered in all patients receiving PICCs. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Case-Control Studies'

29721628,2018,Impact of tumor localization on the outcomes of surgery for an intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. ,"BACKGROUND: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) shows differing clinical outcomes depending on its localization. METHODS: We reviewed the surgical outcomes of 104 ICC patients who underwent liver resection at our institution. We divided ICC into hilar type (HICC) and peripheral type (PICC) depending on positive contact with the hepatic hilum on preoperative computed tomography (CT). RESULTS: The survival outcomes were significantly poorer in HICC patients. HICCs showed a larger tumor size and more frequent bile duct invasion, lymph node metastasis, and non-curative resection than PICC. Resections for HICC had greater blood loss and required a longer operation time, larger hepatectomy, and more frequent extrahepatic bile duct resection. HICCs, even if small in size, also showed a greater tendency to metastasize to the lymph nodes of the hepatoduodenal ligament. Univariate analysis of the ICCs in our current cohort revealed that tumor size, multiple tumors, bile duct invasion, lymph node metastasis, non-curative resection, and HICC are associated with a poorer overall survival outcome. Multivariate analysis indicated that multiple tumors and non-curative resection were independent prognostic factors for survival. Among the curative resection cases, however, survival did not differ significantly between HICC and PICC. The accuracy rate of our CT-based classification for the pathological classification was 81.7%. CONCLUSIONS: HICC shows more frequent bile duct invasion and lymph node metastasis, requires more extensive surgery, and has a higher rate of non-curative resection than PICC. However, if curative resection is achieved, the survival outcomes are expected to be equivalent between HICC and PICC. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Adult' 'Aged' 'Aged, 80 and over'

24142565,2013,"Hospitalist experiences, practice, opinions, and knowledge regarding peripherally inserted central catheters: results of a national survey. ","BACKGROUND: A Michigan survey found variation in hospitalist-reported experience, practice, opinions, and knowledge related to peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs). Whether these findings reflect a national trend is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate self-reported PICC practice among adult hospitalists in the United States. METHODS: Society of Hospital Medicine-administered, anonymous, Web-based survey of practicing, adult, non-Michigan hospitalists. RESULTS: Of the 2112 hospitalists who were sent an electronic invitation, 381 completed the online survey (18%). Eighty-six percent of hospitalists reported having placed a PICC solely for venous access (vs specific indications such as long-term antibiotics or parenteral nutrition). Eighty-two percent reported having cared for a patient who specifically requested a PICC. Only 25% of hospitalists reported examining PICCs for evidence of external problems, whereas 57% admitted to having, at least once, forgotten about the presence of a PICC. Only 9% of respondents knew that PICC tip verification was performed primarily to prevent venous thromboembolism. Finally, 42% of participants indicated that 10% to 25% of PICCs placed in their hospitals might be inappropriately placed and/or avoidable. CONCLUSIONS: This national survey highlights several potential opportunities to improve hospitalist PICC practices. A research agenda dedicated to this issue is necessary to improve patient safety and hospital-based practice. ",['eng'],"['Journal Article' ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]","['Adult'

35943390,2022,Patterns of use and outcomes of peripherally inserted central catheters in hospitalized patients with solid tumors: A multicenter study. ,"BACKGROUND: The risk of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)-related complications in patients hospitalized with solid tumors remains unclear. Existing studies are limited by single-center, outpatient designs and include heterogenous patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was designed and included adult patients with solid organ cancers who were admitted to a general medicine ward or intensive care unit and received a PICC. Data were collected from November 2013 to December 2019 at 50 Michigan hospitals. Major complications were defined as central line-associated bloodstream infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and catheter occlusion. Hospital variation in PICC use and outcomes was examined. RESULTS: Data included 3235 hospitalized patients with solid tumors who had PICCs placed for 51,047 catheter days. Most catheters were double-lumen devices (57.0%). Notably, 17.5% of patients had another central venous catheter at the time of PICC insertion. The most common indications for PICC use were antibiotics (34.5%) and difficult access or blood draws (21.6%); chemotherapy was the primary indication in only 15.7% of patients. A major PICC-related complication occurred in 491 patients (15.2%); catheter occlusion was the most prevalent complication (n = 322; 10.0%) followed by deep vein thrombosis (n = 116; 3.6%), central line-associated bloodstream infection (n = 82; 2.5%), and pulmonary embolism (n = 20; 0.6%). Significant variation in indications for PICC use, device characteristics, and frequency of major complications across hospitals was observed (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: PICCs were associated with significant complications in hospitalized patients who had solid malignancies and were often used for reasons other than chemotherapy. Policies and guidance for the appropriate use of PICCs in oncologic patients appear necessary. LAY SUMMARY: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are devices placed in peripheral veins to deliver medication to large veins near the heart. PICCs are used frequently in oncology. The objective of this report was to describe PICC-associated complications in hospitalized patients with solid tumors. This study was performed across 50 Michigan hospitals and included 3235 patients with solid tumor cancers and who had a PICC. Overall, 15.2% of patients experienced a complication, including central line-associated bloodstream infections, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or catheter occlusion. Complication rates varied across hospitals. PICCs are associated with substantial complications in hospitalized patients with solid tumors.

35763062,2022,"Lowering platelet count threshold to 10,000/µL for peripherally inserted central catheter placement safely conserves blood products. ","Despite the low risk of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) insertion-related bleeding, the practice of administering prophylactic platelets varies greatly. Limiting unnecessary blood product transfusions reduces transfusion-related adverse events, financial cost, and delays in care. We assessed the impact of lowering prophylactic platelet administration threshold on blood product utilization patterns and bleeding events. This quasi-experimental study was conducted in an urban academic tertiary medical center. The study population included patients with platelet counts ≥ 10,000/µL and < 50,000/µL undergoing PICC placement in 2018 and 2019 when the minimum platelet thresholds were 50,000/µL and 10,000/µL, respectively. The primary outcome was blood product utilization and the secondary outcome was PICC insertion-related bleeding complications. Thirty-five patients using the 10,000/µL (10 K) platelet threshold and 46 patients using the 50,000/µL (50 K) platelet threshold were enrolled. The 50 K group received more platelets before PICC insertion (0.870 ± 0.885 and 0.143 ± 0.430 pools of platelets-per-person, p < 0.001). No patients experienced clinically significant bleeding. Immediately following PICC insertion, minor bleeding occurred in five patients (two [4.3%] and three [8.6%] in the 50 K and 10 K groups, respectively). Bleeding rates between the two cohorts did not differ (p = 0.647). Lowering the minimum platelet threshold from 50,000/µL to 10,000/µL resulted in less prophylactic platelet and total blood product administration with no appreciable difference in PICC insertion-related bleeding.

27818170,2016,Association between delivery methods for red blood cell transfusion and the risk of venous thromboembolism: a longitudinal study. ,"BACKGROUND: Mechanisms of red blood cell delivery and their contribution to the incidence of venous thromboembolism are not well understood in the clinical setting. We assessed whether red blood cell transfusion through peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) affects the risk of venous thromboembolism compared with transfusion through non-PICC devices. METHODS: We implemented a prospective study between Jan 1, 2013, and Sept 12, 2015, in patients (age ≥18 years) admitted to a general medicine ward or intensive care unit who received a PICC for any reason during clinical care in 47 hospitals in Michigan, USA, with a maximum follow-up of 70 days. The exposure of interest was route of red blood cell transfusion. The primary outcome was symptomatic, radiographically confirmed, deep-vein thrombosis in the arm or leg or pulmonary embolism. We used Cox proportional hazards regression for analyses. FINDINGS: Venous thromboembolism developed in 482 (5%) of 10 604 patients with PICCs. Of 788 patients who received a red blood cell transfusion through a multi-lumen PICC, 61 had venous thromboembolism. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for venous thromboembolism in all patients whose transfusions were administered through a multi-lumen PICC was 1·96 (95% CI 1·47-2·61; p<0·0001) compared with patients not receiving a transfusion, and was 1·79 (1·09-2·95; p=0·022) compared with patients transfused through a peripheral intravenous line. Compared with delivery through a peripheral intravenous line, venous thromboembolism risk was not elevated if transfusions were delivered through a single-lumen PICC (HR 0·98, 95% CI 0·44-2·14; p=0·95) or central venous catheter (1·50, 0·77-2·91; p=0·23). For every red blood cell unit transfused through a PICC, there was a significantly increased risk of venous thromboembolism (adjusted HR 1·24, 95% CI 1·01-1·52; p=0·037). Patients who received a transfusion through a PICC in the left arm were significantly more likely to develop a deep-vein thrombosis in the ipsilateral arm compared with the contralateral side (HR 23·44, 95% CI 2·96-185·83; p=0·0028). Similarly, patients transfused through a right-sided PICC were more likely to develop deep-vein thrombosis in the ipsilateral arm (HR 3·37, 95% CI 1·02-11·14; p=0·047). INTERPRETATION: Red blood cell delivery through a multi-lumen PICC is associated with a greater risk of thrombosis than transfusion through a peripheral intravenous catheter. Careful monitoring for venous thromboembolism when transfusing red blood cells through multi-lumen PICCs seems necessary.

30673943,2019,The efficacy and safety of a catheter removal only strategy for the treatment of PICC line thrombosis versus standard of care anticoagulation: a retrospective review. ,"Peripherally-inserted central catheters (PICCs) are commonly used during hospitalization. Unfortunately, their use can be complicated by catheter-related thrombosis (CRT). Current guidelines recommend 3-6 months of anticoagulation for patients with CRT after catheter removal. This recommendation is based on extrapolation of data on lower extremity thrombosis, as data is lacking regarding the efficacy and safety of more specific management strategies. Many providers feel catheter removal alone is a reasonable treatment option, particularly for patients at risk for bleeding. We performed a retrospective analysis of hospitalized adult patients diagnosed with CRT at our center. We determined rates of progressive thrombosis and bleeding in cohorts of patients who underwent catheter removal vs those who had catheters removed and received anticoagulation. Among 83 total patients, 62 were treated with PICC removal alone, while 21 underwent PICC removal followed by therapeutic anticoagulation. Patients treated with PICC removal alone were more likely to have hematologic malignancy, receive chemotherapy, develop thrombocytopenia, and have brachial vein thrombosis. No patients in the PICC removal plus anticoagulation arm developed progressive thrombosis, while 6.4% of patients treated with catheter removal alone developed a secondary VTE event, including one PE, three DVTs, and five patients (8%) who developed progressive symptoms leading to initiation of anticoagulation. Major bleeding was significantly more common in the PICC removal + anticoagulation arm (28.5% vs. 4.8% p = 0.007). Catheter-removal alone results in significantly reduced major bleeding compared with catheter-removal plus anticoagulation. In select patients, catheter removal alone may be an option for CRT.

To better guide clinicians, we performed a comprehensive literature review to summarize best practices for this condition. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature for studies reporting epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of PICC-DVT was conducted. Algorithms for diagnosis and management were compiled using available evidence. RESULTS: The incidence of PICC-DVT varied between 2% and 75% according to study population, testing modality and threshold for diagnosis. Studies evaluating the diagnostic utility of clinical symptoms suggested that these were neither sensitive nor specific for PICC-DVT; conversely, ultrasonography had excellent sensitivity and specificity and is recommended as the initial diagnostic test. Although more specific, contrast venography should be reserved for cases with high clinical probability and negative ultrasound findings. Centrally positioned, otherwise functional and clinically necessary PICCs need not be removed despite concomitant DVT. Anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin or warfarin for at least 3 months represents the mainstay of treatment. The role of pharmacologic prophylaxis and screening for PICC-DVT in the absence of clinical symptoms is unclear at this time. CONCLUSIONS: PICC-DVT is common, costly and morbid.

","BACKGROUND: The Michigan Risk Score (MRS) was the only predicted score for peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICC) associated upper extremity venous thrombosis (UEVT). Age-adjusted D-dimer increased the efficiency for UEVT. There were no external validations in an independent cohort. METHOD: A retrospective study of adult patients with PICC insertion was performed. The primary objective was to evaluate the performance of the MRS and age-adjusted D-dimer in estimating risk of PICC-related symptomatic UEVT. The sensitivity, specificity and areas under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) of MRS and age-adjusted D-dimer were calculated. RESULTS: Two thousand one hundred sixty-three patients were included for a total of 206,132 catheter days. Fifty-six (2.6%) developed PICC-UEVT. The incidences of PICC-UEVT were 4.9% for class I, 7.5% for class II, 2.2% for class III, 0% for class IV of MRS (p = 0.011). The incidences of PICC-UEVT were 4.5% for D-dimer above the age-adjusted threshold and 1.5% for below the threshold (p = 0.001). The areas under ROC of MRS and age-adjusted D-dimer were 0.405 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.303-0.508) and 0.639 (95% CI 0.547-0.731). The sensitivity and specificity of MRS were 0.82 (95% CI, 0.69-0.91), 0.09 (95% CI, 0.08-0.11), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of age-adjusted D-dimer were 0.64 (95% CI, 0.46-0.79) and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.61-0.66), respectively.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study that reviewed the medical records of 379 consecutive patients who underwent IVCF insertion during a 39-month period at our center. Of these 379 patients, 28 patients had sequential insertion of an IVCF and a PICC through the same upper extremity venous access. The same vein entry site was used for placement of the IVCF followed by PICC insertion. Data collected included: indication and duration of IVCF and PICC placement, access site location, complications, and the type of IVCF. RESULTS: IVCFs were placed for prophylactic purposes in 15 patients (53.6%) and therapeutic purposes in 13 patients (46.4%). Right upper extremity veins were used for venous access in 27 patients (96.4%): brachial (n=16), basilic (n=9), and cephalic (n=2). The left basilic vein was used in one patient (3.6%). IVCFs were temporary in 20 patients (71.4%) and permanent in 8 patients (28.6%). There were no procedural complications. The OptEase filter was used in 23 patients (82.1%) and the TrapEase filter was used in 5 patients (17.9%). CONCLUSION: Simultaneous IVCF and PICC insertion using the same upper extremity venous access was feasible and safe in our series. This combined technique provides the patient with central venous access for repeated blood collections and intravenous therapy.

25997503,2015,Central venous catheters: incidence and predictive factors of venous thrombosis. ,"AIMS: Central venous catheter access in an acute setting can be a challenge given underlying disease and risk for venous thrombosis. Peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) are commonly placed but limit sites for fistula creation in patients with chronic renal failure (CKD). The aim of this study is to determine the incidence of venous thrombosis from small bore internal jugular (SBIJ) and PICC line placement. This investigation identifies populations of patients who may not be ideal candidates for a PICC and highlights the importance of peripheral vein preservation in patients with renal failure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A venous Doppler ultrasound was performed at the time of SBIJ insertion and removal to evaluate for thrombosis in the internal jugular vein. Data was collected pre- and post-intervention to ascertain if increased vein preservation knowledge amongst the healthcare team led to less use of PICCs. Demographic factors were collected in the SBIJ and PICC groups and risk factor analysis was completed. RESULTS: 1,122 subjects had PICC placement and 23 had SBIJ placement. The incidence of thrombosis in the PICC group was 10%. One patient with an SBIJ had evidence of central vein thrombosis when the catheter was removed. Univariate and multivariate analysis demonstrated a history of transplant, and the indication of total parenteral nutrition was associated with thrombosis (p<0.001). The decrease in PICCs placed in patients with CKD 6 months before and after intervention was significant (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There are subsets of patients ith high risk for thrombosis who may not be ideal candidates for a PICC.

32709498,2020,Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter lines for Intensive Care Unit and onco-hematologic patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis. ,"BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) lines are associated with lower complication rates as compared to conventional Central Venous Catheters (CVCs), especially in high risk patients. OBJECTIVE: To compare Central Line Associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI) and catheter-related thrombosis rates in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and onco-hematologic patients with PICC lines and CVCs. METHODS: We systematically reviewed the PubMed, Cochrane and Google Scholar databases to identify relevant studies. Study quality was evaluated using appropriate assessment tools and the pooled odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Sensitivity analyses were performed based on meta-analysis method, type of study and prophylaxis implementation. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included in our meta-analysis. PICC lines were associated with a significantly higher rate of thrombosis in ICU [OR (95%CI): 2.58(1.80,3.70); P(z)<0.00001] and onco-hematologic [OR (95%CI): 2.91(2.11,4.02); P(z)<0.00001] patients. CLABSI rates with PICC lines were not significantly different in ICU patients [OR (95%CI): 1.65(0.91,2.99); P(z)= 0.1], but significantly lower CLABSI rates were observed in onco-hematologic patients [OR (95%CI): 0.38(0.16,0.91); P(z)=0.03]. Sensitivity analyses verified the robustness of our results. CONCLUSIONS: PICC lines are associated with higher rates of thrombotic events. However, they might be suitable for onco-hematologic patients due to lower CLABSI rates.

25376324,2014,Cutting peripherally inserted central catheters may lead to increased rates of catheter-related deep vein thrombosis. ,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether an association exists between cutting or trimming peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) and the development of deep vein thromboses (DVTs). An observational, retrospective study was conducted on 634 patients who had a PICC inserted between 2011 and 2012. Patients who had a reverse-taper PICC inserted were assigned into 1 of 2 groups. The first group included patients with a reverse-taper PICC that was cut/trimmed (PC) before insertion (n = 224). The second group was made up of patients whose PICC was not cut/trimmed (PNC) before insertion (n = 410). All PICC-associated DVTs were confirmed by a positive venous Doppler result and recorded. A statistically significant difference (P < .001) was found between patients in the PC group who developed a DVT (9.82%) and patients in the PNC group in which PICCs were not trimmed (1.95%). There is evidence to suggest that altering the reverse-taper PICC by cutting or trimming the tip before insertion may be associated with increased DVTs. Further study is required to determine whether PICCs should be reduced in length or whether there is an appropriate method of trimming the catheter to ensure its stability after insertion.

34459038,2022,Dual-lumen power injectable peripherally inserted central catheters in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: A prospective observational study. ,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore whether dual-lumen power injectable peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) could be effectively and safely applied in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) and for serum cyclosporine level monitoring. BACKGROUND: Compared to conventional central venous access devices, PICC provides a feasible route not only for fluid infusion, but also for blood sample collection in patients undergoing oncological treatments. DESIGN: A prospective observational study was conducted according to the STROBE guidelines. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the applications and complications of power injectable PICCs in 52 consecutive allo-HSCT recipients. We also compared the cyclosporine levels in 188 paired blood samples, simultaneously obtained via power injectable PICCs and percutaneous venous puncture, to investigate whether power injectable PICC is a feasible route for cyclosporine concentration monitoring in allo-HSCT. RESULTS: The median PICC placement duration was 29 days. The insertion-site blood oozing and central line-associated bloodstream infection rates were 36.5% (19/52) and 26.9% (14/52), respectively, indicating the feasibility of these PICCs for various applications in allo-HSCT. No power injectable PICC-related thrombotic adverse events were identified; 90.4% (47/52) of cases with power injectable PICC removal occurred because of lack of medical utility, suggesting that power injectable PICC-related complications were manageable. However, cyclosporine levels in samples obtained via these PICCs were significantly higher than those in samples obtained via percutaneous venous puncture (261.5 ± 139.2 vs. 232.4 ± 253.6 ng/ml; p = 0.019 [set 1]; 254.8 ± 89.3 vs. 225.1 ± 233.3 ng/ml; p<0.001 [set 2]; 283.6 ± 103.9 vs. 238.0 ± 254.7 ng/ml; p = 0.006 [set 3]; 291.0 ± 94.9 vs. 266.0 ± 274.7 ng/ml; p = 0.016 [set 4]). CONCLUSION: The power injectable PICC is a feasible venous access device for allo-HSCT. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The dual-lumen power injectable PICCs provided a reliable access for blood sample collection, decreasing the number of blind percutaneous venous punctures in allo-HSCT. However, its application in cyclosporine level monitoring needs further investigation.

34343193,2021,Applicability of TIVAP versus PICC in non-hematological malignancies patients: A meta-analysis and systematic review. ,"BACKGROUND: Applicability of totally implantable venous access port (TIVAP) and peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) in non-hematological malignancies patients remains controversial. METHODS: A systematic studies search in the public databases PubMed, EMBASE, Wan Fang, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), the Cochrane Library and Google Scholar (updated to May 1, 2020) was performed to identify eligible researches. All statistical tests in this meta-analysis were performed using Stata 12.0 software (Stata Corp, College Station, TX). A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included in this final meta-analysis. The pooled data showed that compared with PICC, TIVAP was associated with a higher first-puncture success rate (OR:2.028, 95%CI:1.25-3.289, P<0.05), a lower accidental removal rate (OR:0.447, 95%CI:0.225-0.889, P<0.05) and lower complication rates, including infection (OR:0.570, 95%CI: 0.383-0.850, P<0.05), occlusion (OR:0.172, 95%CI:0.092-0.324, P<0.05), malposition (OR:0.279, 95%CI:0.128-0.608, P<0.05), thrombosis (OR:0.191, 95%CI, 0.111-0.329, P<0.05), phlebitis (OR:0.102, 95%CI, 0.038-0.273, P<0.05), allergy (OR:0.155, 95%CI:0.035-0.696, P<0.05). However, no difference was found in catheter life span (P>0.05) and extravasation (P>0.05). Moreover, TIVAP is more expensive compared with PICC in six-month use (weighted mean difference:3.132, 95%CI:2.434-3.83, P<0.05), but is much similar in 12 months use (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: For the patients with non-hematological malignancies, TIVAP was superior to PICC in the data related to placement and the incidence of complications. Meanwhile, TIVAP is more expensive compared with PICC in six-month use, but it is much similar in twelve-month use.

34226216,2021,Catheter to vein ratio and risk of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)-associated thrombosis according to diagnostic group: a retrospective cohort study. ,"OBJECTIVES: Determine the effect of the catheter to vein ratio (CVR) on rates of symptomatic thrombosis in individuals with a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) and identify the optimal CVR cut-off point according to diagnostic group. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: 4 tertiary hospitals in Australia and New Zealand. PARTICIPANTS: Adults who had undergone PICC insertion. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Symptomatic thrombus of the limb in which the PICC was inserted. RESULTS: 2438 PICC insertions were included with 39 cases of thrombosis (1.6%; 95% CI 1.14% to 2.19%). Receiver operator characteristic analysis was unable to be performed to determine the optimal CVR overall or according to diagnosis. The association between risk of thrombosis and CVR cut-offs commonly used in clinical practice were analysed. A 45% cut-off (≤45% versus ≥46%) was predictive of thrombosis, with those with a higher ratio having more than twice the risk (relative risk 2.30; 95% CI 1.202 to 4.383; p=0.01). This pattern continued when only those with malignancy were included in the analysis, those with cancer had twice the risk of thrombosis with a CVR greater than 45%. Whereas the 33% CVR cut-off was not associated with statistically significant results overall or in those with malignancy. Neither the 33% or 45% CVR cut-off produced statistically significant results in those with infection or other non-malignant conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to CVR cut-offs are an important component of PICC insertion clinical decision making to reduce the risk of thrombosis. These results suggest that in individuals with cancer, the use of a CVR ≤45% should be considered to minimise risk of thrombosis. Further research is needed to determine the risk of thrombosis according to malignancy type and the optimal CVR for those with a non-malignant diagnosis.

METHODS: This study was carried out in a 32-bed NSICU in a large academic hospital in the USA from July 2015 until January 2017. Patients admitted requiring central venous access were randomly assigned to have a PICC or CVC inserted. Complications were recorded and compared. The primary outcome was all complications as well as combined numbers of large vein thrombosis, central-line-associated blood stream infections, and insertional trauma. Outcomes were compared using the Fisher's exact test, logistic regression, or unpaired T tests, as appropriate. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-two patients were enrolled; 72 were randomized to the PICC arm and 80 to the CVC arm. There were no crossovers, withdrawals, nor losses to follow-up. The study was stopped at the second pre-planned interim analysis for futility. The combined number of large vein thrombosis, central-line-associated blood stream infection, and insertional trauma was 4/72 in the PICC arm and 1/80 in the CVC group (OR 4.6 (95% CI 0.5-42.6) p = 0.14). The number of all complications in the PICC arm was 14/72 compared to 10/80 in the CVC arm (OR 1.7 (95% CI 0.7-4.1) p = 0.24).

34137321,2023,"Subcutaneously anchored securement for peripherally inserted central catheters: Immediate, early, and late complications. ","BACKGROUND: An adequate stabilization of a vascular device is an important part of insertion bundles and is an effective strategy in reducing complications. Dislodgment has a relevant clinical impact and an increase in healthcare costs. METHOD: We have retrospectively investigated the safety and efficacy of Subcutaneously Anchored Securement (SAS) for Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters (PICC) in cancer patients. RESULTS: We analyzed 639 patients who had a PICC inserted and secured with SAS, over the past 3 years (2018-2020). No immediate complications during SAS placement were reported. In the first 24-48 h, a slight local ecchymosis was reported in 24 cases with rapid spontaneous resolution. No cases of bleeding or hematoma of the exit site were reported. The total number of catheter days was 93078. Dislodgment occurred only in seven cases (1.1%). In 16 patients, the PICC was removed because of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): the overall incidence of CRBSI was 0.17 per 1000 catheter days. Symptomatic venous thrombosis was documented in 12 patients (1.9%) and treated with low molecular weight heparin without PICC removal. We had no cases of irreversible lumen occlusion. In 17 patients, local discomfort-including device-related pressure ulcers and painful inflammation-was reported: these cases were treated without SAS removal or PICC removal. CONCLUSION: In this retrospective analysis, subcutaneously anchored securement of PICCs was a safe and effective strategy for reducing the risk of dislodgment.

36681296,2023,Different diagnostic strategies using D-dimer for peripherally inserted central catheter-related upper extremity deep vein thrombosis. ,"OBJECTIVE: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremities caused by a peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) is distinct from the typical DVT. This specific type of mural thrombus might have an effect on the D-dimer levels. In the present study, we aimed to ascertain whether the D-dimer level might be considered an independent diagnostic marker to rule out upper extremity DVT caused by PICCs. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case-cohort study of 205 patients who had undergone D-dimer measurement and color Doppler ultrasound within 14 days after placement of a PICC to December 31, 2020, from January 1, 2018. The participants were followed up for 3 months to evaluate for upper extremity DVT. In addition, different D-dimer diagnostic strategies were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 205 included patients, 53 (25.9%) had had a negative D-dimer level. Of the 53 patients, 10 had had upper extremity DVT attributable to a PICC using color Doppler ultrasound. Of these 10 patients, 3 had developed upper extremity DVT during the 3-month follow-up. Using the various D-dimer diagnostic techniques, the negative predictive value for the D-dimer levels was 81.1%. CONCLUSIONS: The present study has shown that the different D-dimer diagnostic strategies are not effective for safely excluding the diagnosis of suspected PICC-related upper extremity DVT. Adding PICC placement as a special factor in the modified Wells score, in addition to the D-dimer level, could securely rule out PICC-related upper extremity DVT; however, the diagnostic efficacy was low.

34729630,2022,Reduction of perioperative venous thrombus formation by antithrombotic peripherally inserted central catheter in esophageal cancer. ,"PURPOSE: Although a central venous catheter (CVC) is often needed perioperatively for intraoperative and nutritional management of esophageal cancer (EC), the catheter placement impacts the risk of venous thrombosis. We examined the risks of thrombus formation by catheter type, placement, and duration. METHODS: In total, 226 patients with EC were enrolled in this retrospective study. Patients were classified into one of three groups: those with a conventional CVC (cCVC), a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC), or an antithrombogenic agent-coated PICC (secPICC). The thrombus formation and clinicopathological features were examined. RESULTS: The frequency of all types of thrombosis was significantly lower in the secPICC group (p < 0.01). Although deep vein thrombosis was frequent in the cCVC group, catheter thrombosis was frequent in the PICC group. In a univariate analysis in patients with the PICC and secPICC groups, less thrombus formation was observed in the secPICC (p = 0.01), short placement time (p = 0.02), and right-sided placement (p < 0.01). Furthermore, a multivariate analysis revealed that secPICC (p = 0.049) and right-sided placement (p = 0.04) significantly reduced rates of thrombus formation. CONCLUSION: In patients with EC, secPICC and right-sided placement reduce perioperative venous thrombus formation. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['*Catheterization, Central Venous/adverse effects'

Few studies have focused on the relationships between venous thrombosis and venous characteristics. This study aimed to identify effects of venous characteristics on symptomatic PICC-related venous thrombosis in cancer patients and explore the relationship between venous characteristics and blood flow velocity. METHODS: The data of patients who underwent placement of PICC were retrospectively studied between January 2015 and September 2017. Symptomatic PICC-related venous thrombosis was confirmed by ultrasound. Univariable, multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with PICC-related venous thrombosis. In October 2017, 169 patients with PICCs were enrolled prospectively, and the relationships between blood flow velocity and venous characteristics were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 2933 cancer patients were enrolled in this study; of these patients, 68 experienced symptomatic venous thrombosis. In the bivariate analysis, body mass index (BMI), history of venous thrombosis, triglycerides, tumor category, vessel diameter, vessel depth and arm circumference were associated with thrombosis. The multivariable analyses showed that arm circumference, vascular diameter, triglyceride level and tumor category were independent risk factors for thrombosis. Blood flow velocity was positively correlated with vessel depth and arm circumference but not with vessel diameter. CONCLUSION: Different venous characteristics can lead to different blood flow rates, which can affect the incidence of thrombosis. A vein depth of greater than 1.07cm or less than 0.57cm was associated with a higher incidence of PICC-related venous thrombosis, and the greater the arm circumference and vessel diameter, the greater the risk of venous thrombosis.

This study aimed to compare the incidence of PICC-related bloodstream infections (PICCR-BSIs) in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy and in noncancer patients. We performed a secondary analysis from a retrospective, single-center, observational cohort. The PICCR-BSI incidence rates in cancer and noncancer patients were compared after 1:1 propensity-score matching. Then, the factors associated with PICCR-BSI were assessed in a Cox model. Among the 721 PICCs (627 patients) included in the analysis, 240 were placed in cancer patients for chemotherapy and 481 in noncancer patients. After propensity-score matching, the PICCR-BSI incidence rate was 2.6 per 1000 catheter days in cancer patients and 1.0 per 1000 catheter days in noncancer patients (p < 0.05). However, after adjusting for variables resulting in an imbalance between groups after propensity-score matching, only the number of PICC lumens was independently associated with PICCR-BSI (adjusted hazard ratio 1.81, 95% confidence interval: 1.01-3.22; p = 0.04). In conclusion, the incidence rate of PICCR-BSI is higher in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy than in noncancer patients, but our results also highlight the importance of limiting the number of PICC lumens in such patients.

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 1659 patients who accepted successful tip-conductive PICC placement and clinically followed-up until the catheter removal between January 2018 and April 2019. Baseline of patient characteristics, catheter placement characteristics, date of dressing changes as well as records of catheter-related complications were extracted from a special designed mobile APP. RESULTS: The first-attempt success (success of placing catheter tip to the ideal position by primary indwelling operation) rate of PICC placement was 99.3%. The average duration of PICC placement was 128.7 ± 39.5 days and 1535 patients (92.5%) reached the therapy end-point without any complications and removed the catheter normally. The cumulative rates of total complications were 7.5%, including exit site infection (2.5%), phlebitis (0.9%), DVT (1.0%), catheter malposition (1.1%), catheter breakage (0.1%), and liquid extravasation (1.8%). In multivariable logistic regression analyses, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, lung cancer, stomach cancer, and lymphoma were significantly associated with increased risk of complications, as the independent risk factors.

DESIGN: Nested case-control study. SETTING: Barnes-Jewish Hospital, a 1,252-bed tertiary care teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Adult patients with PICCs placed from January 1, 2006, through July 31, 2008. METHODS: PICC BSI cases were identified using the National Healthcare Safety Network definition. Uninfected control patients with PICCs in place were randomly selected at a 3∶1 ratio. Patient- and device-related variables were examined using multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The overall PICC BSI rate was 3.13 per 1,000 catheter-days. Independent risk factors for PICC BSIs included congestive heart failure (odds ratio [OR], 2.0 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.26-3.17]; P = .003), intra-abdominal perforation (OR, 5.66 [95% CI, 1.76-18.19]; P = .004), Clostidium difficile infection (OR, 2.25 [95% CI, 1.17-4.33]; P = .02), recent chemotherapy (OR, 3.36 [95% CI, 1.15-9.78]; P = .03), presence of tracheostomy (OR, 5.88 [95% CI, 2.99-11.55]; P < .001), and type of catheter (OR for double lumen, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.15-3.10]; P = .01 ; OR for triple lumen, 2.87 [95% CI, 1.39-5.92]; P = .004). Underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.29-0.78]; P = .03) and admission to surgical (OR, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.24-0.79]; P = .006) or oncology and orthopedic (OR, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.13-0.99]; P = .05) services were less likely to be associated with having a PICC BSI. CONCLUSIONS: We identified several novel factors related to PICC BSIs. These factors may inform preventive measures. ",['eng'],"['Journal Article' ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""

26025158,2015,Peripherally inserted central catheter placement in patients with coagulation disorders: A retrospective analysis. ,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety of peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) placement in patients with altered and uncorrected coagulation parameters or receiving antiplatelet therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical charts of all patients with major primary and secondary hemostasis disorders, combined hemostasis disorders or on antiplatelet therapy and who had undergone non-tunneled PICC placement from December 2009 to December 2013, were retrospectively reviewed. A hemostatic disorder was defined as a platelet count (PC)≤50×10(9)/L, an international normalized ratio (INR) ≥ 2, or an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)≥66s, alone or in combination. Underlying hemostasis disorders were not corrected and antiplatelet therapy was not interrupted before PICC placement in any patient. 4, and 5-Fr single and dual lumen PICCs were used. RESULTS: A total of 378 PICCs were placed in 271 patients (180 men and 91 women; mean age=62±13.4years; range, 18-93 years)) with coagulation disorders. Eighty-nine (23%) PICCs were placed in patients who were receiving antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel, rivaroxaban). Thrombocytopenia was noted in 269PICC placements (71%). Among these patients, 23 had disseminated intravascular coagulation. Prolonged INR and aPTT were observed in 42 procedures (11.1%). PICC placement was achieved in all patients, with a mean number of 1.14 attempts. Peripheral venous access was obtained through the basilic and the brachial vein respectively in 295 (79.1%) and 83 (20.9%) of patients. The placements were performed by residents and fellows in 108 (28.5%) and 270 (71.5%) procedures, respectively. No early or late complications were reported after any procedure. No accidental puncture of the brachial artery occurred. CONCLUSION: In patients with severe primary and secondary hemostasis disorders, combined hemostasis disorders or on antiplatelet therapy, PICC placement is a feasible and safe procedure and does not require correction of coagulation parameters or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy.

30560363,2019,Impact of subcutaneous tunnels on peripherally inserted catheter placement: a multicenter retrospective study. ,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of subcutaneous tunneling on peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placement in terms of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs). METHODS: Our dual-facility central institutional review board approved this retrospective study. We compared 302 of 327 consecutive recipients (mean age [± SD], 68.0 ± 15.9 years; men, 134; women, 168) of tunneled PICCs (October 2017 to May 2018) with 309 of 328 consecutive recipients (mean age, 68.7 ± 14.6 years; men, 142; women, 167) of conventional PICCs (April 2016 to September 2017). Tunnels were made near puncture sites (~ 1 in. away) using hemostats or puncture needles. In each group, procedure times and rates of complications, including CLABSI, entry-site infection, dislocation, thrombophlebitis, and occlusion, were examined. Risk factors for CLABSI were analyzed via logistic and Cox regression models. RESULTS: Subcutaneous tunnels were achieved in all patients, enabling successful peripheral vein cannulations. Group procedure times were similar (p = 0.414). CLABSI proved to be significantly less frequent after tunneling (8/6972 catheter-days) than after conventional (28/7574 catheter-days) PICC placement (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.328; 95% confidence interval, 0.149-0.721). Other risk factors (i.e., age, gender, comorbidity, PICC duration, veins, hospital stay, and intensive care unit stay) showed no significant correlations with CLABSI. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with conventional means, a subcutaneous tunneling approach for PICC placement significantly reduces the rate of CLABSI. KEY POINTS: • Subcutaneous tunnels created to place peripherally inserted central catheters significantly reduced catheter-associated bloodstream infections. • Subcutaneous tunnel creation did not significantly prolong procedural time. • There were no subcutaneous tunnel-related complications.

29148003,2018,Prevalence of medical adhesive-related skin injury at peripherally inserted central catheter insertion site in oncology patients. ,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to identify the prevalence and risk factors of medical adhesive-related skin injuries (MARSI) at peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) insertion site in oncology patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study lasting two weeks was carried out in four inpatient departments. Skin assessment data and photographs of skin were collected during PICC maintenance. Other related information came from medical records. The skin injuries were classified by dermatologists and PICC specialized nurses. MARSI prevalence was calculated and the associated factors were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: All 419 patients were included. The prevalence of total MARSI at PICC insertion site was 125, (29.83%), including mechanical skin injury (73, 17.42%), contact dermatitis (CD) (39, 9.31%), moisture-associated skin damage (11, 2.63%), folliculitis (2, 0.48%). Multivariate analysis identified two independent risk factors for MARSI including age ≥50 y (p = 0.031, odds ratio [OR] = 4.521, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.389, 20.620]) and hematologic malignancies (p = 0.000, OR = 2.514, 95% CI [1.590,3.97]. Oxaliplatin and arsenic trioxide infusion through PICC, history of skin allergies was associated with CD, with p = 0.020, OR = 3.492, 95% CI (1.220, 9.990); p = 0.003, OR = 4.565, 95% CI (1.661,12.547); p = 0.000, OR = 12.333, 95% CI (3.669, 41.454), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MARSI at PICC insertion site is a frequent event among oncology patients. Epidemiological data and independent risk factors are presented in our study, which provide a basis for future study in this area.

28202859,2017,Experience of Peripherally Inserted Central Venous Catheter in Patients with Hematologic Diseases. ,"Objective Although use of the peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) has become increasingly common, there are few reports of PICCs used for patients with hematologic diseases. In this study, we analyzed the safety of PICC placement in patients with hematologic diseases where PICCs had been placed to perform blood collection, blood transfusion, drug administration, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Methods This study included 142 PICCs placed in 95 patients managed at our department from November 2013 to December 2015. The PICCs used were the Groshong(®) Catheter (NXT single-lumen; BARD Inc.). Results A total of 95 patients underwent the placement of 142 PICCs. The mean patient age was 65.5 years. The total duration of catheterization was 8,089 days, with a mean duration of 57.0 days. Chemotherapy was administered through 107 catheters. Stem cells were injected through 12 catheters. Although a fever was observed in association with 103 catheters, it was generally controlled by antimicrobial therapy. There were 18 catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) cases, an incidence equivalent to 2.1 cases per 1,000 catheter-days. Conclusion The present study demonstrated a low CRBSI incidence rate and found no evidence of serious complications with PICC placement. PICCs can be used for blood collection, blood transfusion, drug administration, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation without problems. Thus, PICC placement appears to be a safe procedure for patients with hematologic diseases. Safe catheters are therefore urgently needed for these patients. We expect that PICCs will be widely adopted in Japan in the near future. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Adult' 'Aged' 'Aged, 80 and over' 'Bacteremia/etiology'

28144088,2016,"Outcomes, cost comparison, and patient satisfaction during long-term central venous access in cancer patients: Experience from a Tertiary Care Cancer Institute in South India. ","INTRODUCTION: Prolonged treatment, frequent administration of chemotherapy, antibiotics and blood products in cancer patients requires long term venous access. Central venous catheters (CVC) inserted into the subclavian vein or internal jugular vein, peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICC) and chemoport (CP) are the commonly used central venous access devices (CVAD). AIM: This study was envisaged to review our experience of CVADs over a one year period and analyze the outcome with regard to catheter life, reasons for removal, complications, patient satisfaction and cost comparison between the CVAD types in the Indian setting. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a prospective, observational study carried out in a tertiary care cancer institute. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 180 CVADs placed in patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors from January 2014 to December 2014 were included. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics, Mann Whitney U test. P <0.05 was taken as statistically significant. RESULTS: 180 CVADs were placed in 160 patients. The median catheter indwelling period was 76 days (16 days to 313 days) for CVC, 59 days (20days - 313 days) for PICC and 137 days (70 days - 258 days) for CP. 66 out of 160 patients developed complications (41.2%). 108 complication events were noted in 66 patients. There were 40 episodes of CRBSI. Out of the 68 mechanical complications, 37 were encountered during insertion of the CVAD and 31 were during the catheter indwelling period. Out of 160 patients, 138 (86.25%) were satisfied with the CVAD. The cost incurred for CVC/PICC (INR 4,480) was lower than that for CP (INR 24,150) and it was statistically significant (P < 0.0001). Our patients were highly satisfied with the CVAD. CONCLUSION: Use of CVC and PICC is a safe, reliable and cost saving way of administration of chemotherapy in developing countries. The incidence of complications and catheter loss was acceptable. Our patients were highly satisfied with the CVAD.

30379146,2019,Less Lumens-Less Risk: A Pilot Intervention to Increase the Use of Single-Lumen Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters. ,"To reduce risk of complications, existing guidelines recommend use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) with the minimal number of lumens. This recommendation, however, is difficult to implement in practice. We conducted a pilot study to increase the use of single-lumen PICCs in hospitalized patients. The intervention included (1) education for physicians, pharmacists, and nurses; (2) changes to the electronic PICC order-set that set single lumen PICCs as default; and (3) criteria defining when use of multilumen PICCs is appropriate. The intervention was supported by real-time monitoring and feedback. Among 226 consecutive PICCs, 64.7% of preintervention devices were single lumen versus 93.6% postintervention (P < .001). The proportion of PICCs with an inappropriate number of lumens decreased from 25.6% preintervention to 2.2% postintervention (P < .001). No cases suggesting inadequate venous access or orders for the placement of a second PICC were observed. Implementing a single-lumen PICC default and providing education and indications for multilumen devices improved PICC appropriateness.

35587883,2022,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters Versus Central Venous Catheters for in-Hospital Parenteral Nutrition. ,"OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the use of peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) by a vascular access team (VAT) versus central venous catheters (CVCs) for in-hospital total parenteral nutrition (TPN). METHODS: The study used a cost-effectiveness analysis based on observational data retrospectively obtained from electronic medical records from 2018 to 2019 in a teaching hospital. We included all interventional procedures requiring PICCs or CVCs with the indication of TPN. We recorded the costs of insertion, maintenance, removal, and complications. The main outcome measure was the incidence rate of catheter-associated bacteremia per 1000 catheter days. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from the hospital perspective within the context of the publicly funded Spanish health system. Confidence intervals for costs and effectiveness differences were calculated using bootstrap methods. RESULTS: We analyzed 233 CVCs and 292 PICCs from patients receiving TPN. Average duration was longer for PICC (13 versus 9.4 days, P &lt; 0.001). The main reason for complications in both groups was suspected infection (9.77% CVC versus 5.18% PICC). Complication rates due to bacteremia were 2.44% for CVC and 1.15% for PICC. The difference in the incidence of bacteremia per 1000 catheter days was 1.29 (95% confidence interval, -0.89 to 3.90). Overall, costs were lower for PICCs than for CVCs: the difference in mean overall costs was -€559.9 (95% confidence interval, -€919.9 to -€225.4). Uncertainty analysis showed 86.37% of results with lower costs and higher effectiveness for PICC versus CVC. CONCLUSIONS: Placement of PICC by VAT compared with CVC for TPN reduces costs and may decrease the rate of bacteremia.

34296629,2023,Effects of indwelling centrally inserted central catheter on tip location of peripherally inserted central catheter with intracavitary electrocardiogram guidance: A retrospective case-control study. ,"BACKGROUND: Intracavity electrocardiogram (IC-ECG) guidance is an effective technology for monitoring the tip locations of centrally inserted central catheters (CICCs) and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs). However, for patients with an indwelling CICC, there has been no study on whether the CICC affects PICC tip positioning with IC-ECG guidance. METHODS: Thirty people with a CICC requiring PICC insertion, matched with age to controls without a CICC. The stability of IC-ECG waveforms, the amplitude of P-waves, and the accuracy of PICC tip location were compared. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the stability of the IC-ECG waveforms (χ(2) = 0.22, p = 0.64). The amplitudes of baseline P-waves and ideal P-waves also showed no significant difference (t1 = 0.06, p1 = 0.96, t2 = 0.80, p2 = 0.43). Neither the accuracy of tip location (χ(2) = 1.40, p = 0.50) nor the distance of PICC tip (t = -0.03, p = 0.98) were significantly different. CONCLUSION: For patients with an indwelling CICC, the position of PICC tip can be accurately determined by the dynamic changes in the P-wave amplitude.

24137199,2013,The complete recanalization of PICC-related venous thrombosis in cancer patients: A series of case reports. ,"In this study, cancer patients with venous thrombosis associated with the use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) underwent complete recanalization by the administration of Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS), which vary from heparin or urokinase in that they do not have the same risks associated with thrombolysis, including bleeding. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study concerning the treatment of cancers with PNS to be reported in the literature. Three cancer patients aged 30-50 years old, two females and one male, were subjected to chemotherapy. On the first day of chemotherapy, a PICC was inserted into the right basilic vein with its tip in the superior vena cava. On the third day of chemotherapy, pain, swelling and skin flushing started. In the following days, particularly days 10-13, a Doppler ultrasound examination confirmed a long thrombus along the PICC line in the axillary vein and brachial veins in each patient. The patients rejected the insertion of an inferior vena cava filter, and neither heparin nor urokinase were administered due to contra-indications. An injection of PNS (200 mg) was administered every day. On days 20-28 of chemotherapy, the thrombus in the axillary and brachial veins disappeared in the three patients. It was concluded that PNS promote blood circulation, which prevents blood stasis and reduces the toxicity of cisplatin. The results suggest that PNS are a feasible and effective treatment option for many types of cancer, but have a broader clinical impact on cancer patients with PICC-related venous thrombosis. Therefore, this study is an original case report of particular interest to cancer patients with PICC-related venous thrombosis.

29974358,2018,Optimal vascular access strategies for patients receiving chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer: a systematic review. ,"IMPORTANCE: Systemic chemotherapy can be administered either through a peripheral vein (IV), or centrally through peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC), totally implanted vascular access devices (PORTs) or tunnelled cuffed catheters. Despite the widespread use of systemic chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer, the optimal choice of vascular access is unknown. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review evaluated complication rates and patient satisfaction with different access strategies for administering neo/adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. EVIDENCE REVIEWED: Ovid Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from 1946 to September 2017. Two reviewers independently assessed each citation. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the quality of cohort and case-control studies. FINDINGS: Of 1584 citations identified, 15 unique studies met the pre-specified eligibility criteria. There were no randomised studies comparing types of vascular access. Reports included six single-institution retrospective cohort studies, one retrospective multi-institution cohort, one retrospective cohort database study, five prospective single-institution studies, one prospective multi-institution study and one nested case-control study. Median complication rates were infection: 6.0% PICC (2 studies) versus 2.1% PORT (8 studies); thrombosis: 8.9% PICC (2 studies) versus 2.6% PORT (9 studies); extravasation: 0 PICC (1 study) versus 0.4% PORT (4 studies) and mechanical issues: PICC 3.8% (1 study) versus 1.8% PORT (9 studies). Satisfaction/quality of life appeared high with each device. CONCLUSION: In the absence of high-quality data comparing vascular access strategies, randomised, adequately powered, prospective studies would be required to help inform clinical practice and reduce variation.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study of 2825 adult patients (male 51.2%, female 48.8%) who had a PICC insertion from January 2017 to December 2019. The data collected includes gender, eGFR value at the date of insertion, accessed vein and side, ongoing or subsequent dialysis within 1 year, and death within 1 year of the insertion date. The study excluded pediatric patients, patients with missing eGFR values prior to the procedure and follow-up information. RESULT: PICC insertion was done in patients with eGFR⩽45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) in 26.7% (724/2709) of the sample. Ongoing dialysis was documented in 10.2% (198/1946) and subsequent dialysis in 6.5% of the patients within the year after insertion. The overall death rate for the year post PICC insertion was 38.7% (1094/2825), which was significantly higher in low eGFR patients (413/724, 57%) compared to patients with eGFR>45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (632/1985, 31.8%) (p-value < 0.0001, odds ratio 2.84 (95% confidence interval 2.38-3.38)). The rate of dialysis initiated in the year post PICC insertion was 5.9% (98/1657). This was significantly higher in patients with a low eGFR and not previously dialyzed (59/310, 19%) compared to patients with eGFR>45 who required dialysis in the year post insertion (39/1347, 2.9%) (p < 0.0001, odds ratio 7.88 (95% confidence interval 5.14-12.07)). CONCLUSION: PICC insertion in patients with CKD is practiced frequently. Rigorous strategies should be implemented to improve adherence to clinical practice guidelines and reduce unnecessary insertions and preserve veins for when an AVF may be required.

35287828,2022,The role of body mass index in the development of thromboembolic events among cancer patients with PICCs: a systematic review. ,"OBJECTIVE: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) guarantee a stable and safe vascular access to administer irritants or vesicants therapies. However, they may occasionally be affected by relevant thrombotic complications especially in patients with hypercoagulability such as oncological patients. Among the identification of independent risk factors, the role of body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m(2) is now emerging in literature with conflicting results. The aim of this systematic review is to analyze the available scientific literature in order to determine whether BMI could represent a risk factor in the development of thromboembolic event among cancer patients with PICCs. DATA SOURCES AND REVIEW METHODS: A scientific literature review was performed in Pubmed, Embase and Cinahl from Jan 1, 2010 to September 10, 2020 in which we identified 100 records. Of these, 88 were excluded and 14 were reviewed in full text. Among the reviewed records, 6 articles satisfied the inclusion criteria for analysis. These criteria included the English language, oncological patients with PICCs, the evaluation of catheter-related thrombosis as well as the stratification of patients according to BMI. Studies off topic and lacking data on PICC related complications among overweight and underweight patients were excluded. The includedstudies, judged with Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, was fair-lower quality. The primary endpoint was the relative risk (RR) of PICC-related thrombosis of overweight/obese vs normal weight/underweight (i.e., BMI ≥25 vs <25 kg/m(2)) in cancer patients. RESULTS: A total of 2431 patients were included in the analysis. Overall, 15.1% of patients developed PICC-related thrombosis within a median time of 23.2 days (range 11.0-42.5) after PICC implantation. Concerning BMI, 52.6% of the entire population was overweight/obese. We assessed the proportion of patients with PICC-related thrombotic events in the two groups, with 28% (95% CI, 12%-45%) of events registered in the overweight/obese patients cohort, and 13% (95% CI, 6%-19%) in the normal weight/underweight cohort. The pooled relative risk (RR) was 2.06 (95% CI, 1.21-3.49, p<0.001) in overweight/obese vs normal weight/underweight patients. CONCLUSION: This review showed a two-fold risk of thrombosis in overweight/obese compared to normal weight/underweight oncological patients with PICCs. Underweight condition could also play a role in thrombosis development, especially in nasopharyngeal and digestive system cancer. Future prospective studies are needed to achieve reliable results and produce useful conclusion.

","PURPOSE: To evaluate incidence and risk factors of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)-related complications in cancer patients. METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, cohort study of cancer patients with PICC insertion was performed from February 1, 2013 to April 24, 2014. All patients were monitored in clinic until PICCs were removed. The primary endpoint was PICC removal due to complications. Patient-, catheter- and insertion-related factors were analyzed in univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify significant independent risk factors for PICC-related complications. RESULTS: There were 477 cancer patients included, for a total of 50,841 catheter-days. Eighty-one patients (17.0%) developed PICC-related complications, with an incidence of 1.59 per 1000 catheter days. Thirty-six (7.5%) PICCs were removed because of complications. The most common complications were skin allergy (4.6%), catheter occlusion (3.4%) and accidental withdrawal (2.3%). Nine (1.9%) patients developed symptomatic upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (UEDVT) and central line associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) was shown in six (1.3%) PICCs with an infection rate 0.12 per 1000 catheter days. In multivariable analysis, body mass index (BMI) >25 (odds ratio, 2.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-3.47, p = 0.004) was shown to be a significant risk factor for PICC complications. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients with BMI greater than 25 were more likely to have PICC complications.

35645580,2022,Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter by Interventional Nephrologists: Experiences from a Single Center. ,"PURPOSE: As the number of patients with chronic kidney disease increases, nephrologist activities are gradually expanding. This study evaluated the safety and success of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) performed by nephrologists. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of a medical center. All patients underwent a PICC procedure by two nephrologists. The reasons for catheter removal were classified as accidental removal; treatment termination; catheter occlusion; vessel thrombosis; catheter-related infection, or patient death. Overall catheter complications were defined as catheter occlusion, vessel thrombosis, or catheter-related infection. RESULTS: A total of 335 catheterizations among 286 patients were performed. Overall, catheter removal was required during follow-up in 251 of 335 cases. The catheter was removed in 48 out of 251 (19.1%) cases with catheter-related complications. In univariate and multivariate analyses, diabetes mellitus was associated with catheter-related infection. The catheter survival rates were 85.3% at 1 month. In univariate and multivariate analyses, diabetes mellitus and fluoroscopy-guided insertion were associated with favorable catheter survival. CONCLUSION: The results of our study showed high success and low complication rates for PICC insertion by nephrologists. These findings indicate that interventional nephrologists already skilled in other procedures can expand their field of activity and profit.

33986427,2021,Comparison of different techniques for the management of venous steno-occlusive lesions during placement of peripherally inserted central catheter. ,"The purpose of this study is to investigate strategies for peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placement in patients with venous steno-occlusive lesion (VSOL). We performed a retrospective cohort study in adults with central or peripheral VSOL who underwent PICC placement procedures from January 2015 to December 2018. Four different strategies [selecting alternative pathway/over the wire (SAP/OTW), percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), re-puncture in ipsilateral arm (RIA), and catheter placement in the contralateral arm (CICA)] were analyzed and we compared the clinical outcomes by strategy and compared the strategy between central and peripheral VSOLs. During 4 years, 258 PICC procedures performed in patients with VSOLs, 100 PICC were included in the analysis. The overall technical success rate of initial attempt with SAP/OTW was 32.2%. As a second-line technique, PTA was most frequently used in both central (100%) and peripheral (68.2%) VSOL groups. The clinical success rates within 2 months of SAP/OTW, PTA, RIA, CICA were 55.2%, 43.2%, 14.3%, and 33.3%, respectively (P = 0.24). In conclusion, when the SAP/OTW failed, the PTA can be preferred as a second-line technique for both central and peripheral VSOLs. When guidewire passage fails, the operator could adopt the RIA or CICA technique as an alternative method.

28978332,2017,Central venous Access device SeCurement And Dressing Effectiveness for peripherally inserted central catheters in adult acute hospital patients (CASCADE): a pilot randomised controlled trial. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are commonly used for delivering intravenous therapy. PICC failure is unacceptably high (up to 40%) due to mechanical, infectious and thrombotic complications. Poor securement potentiates all complication types. This randomised controlled trial (RCT) aimed to examine the feasibility of a large RCT of four dressing and securement methods to prevent PICC failure. METHODS: This single-centre pilot RCT included 124 admitted medical/surgical/cancer patients aged ≥ 16 years with a PICC. Interventions were: (i) standard polyurethane dressing and sutureless securement device (SPU + SSD, control); (ii) polyurethane with absorbent lattice pad dressing (PAL + Tape); (iii) combination securement-dressing (CSD); and (iv) tissue adhesive (TA + SPU). All groups except TA + SPU had a chlorhexidine-gluconate (CHG) impregnated disc. Feasibility outcomes were recruitment and safety/acceptability of the interventions. The primary outcome was PICC failure, a composite of PICC removal for local infection, catheter-associated bloodstream infection, dislodgement, occlusion, and/or catheter fracture. Secondary outcomes included individual complications, dressing failure and dwell time, PICC dwell time, skin complications/phlebitis indicators, product costs, and patient and staff satisfaction. Qualitative feedback was also collected. RESULTS: PICC failure incidence was: PAL + CHG + Tape (1/5; 20%; 17.4/1000 days), SPU + SSD + CHG (control) (4/39; 10%; 9.0/1000 days), TA + SPU (3/35; 9%; 9.6/1000 days), and CSD + CHG (3/42; 7%; 9.4/1000 days). Recruitment to PAL + CHG + Tape was ceased after five participants due to concerns of PICC dislodgement when removing the dressing. CSD + CHG, TA + SPU (TA applied only at PICC insertion time), and control treatments were acceptable to patients and health professionals. CONCLUSION: A large RCT of CSD + CHG and TA + SPU (but not PAL + CHG + Tape) versus standard care is feasible.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Two community SNFs. PARTICIPANTS: Adult SNF residents with PICCs (N = 56). MEASUREMENTS: Information on indication for PICC use, device characteristics (e.g., lumens, gauge), and participant data (comorbidities, medications) were obtained from medical records. Care practices (e.g., frequency of flushing, dressing care) and problems related to PICCs were recorded. Major (central line-associated bloodstream infection, venous thromboembolism, catheter dislodgement) and minor (migration, dressing disruption, lumen occlusion, exit site infection) complications and process measures (flushing of PICC, assessment of necessity) were recorded. Bivariate analyses with t-tests, chi-square tests, or Fischer exact tests were used for continuous and categorical data. RESULTS: Participants were enrolled from two SNFs. The most common indication for PICC use was intravenous antibiotic delivery. The average PICC dwell time was 43 days, and most devices were single-lumen PICCs. Major and minor complications were common and occurred in 11 (20%) and 18 (32%) participants, respectively. Occlusion (23%, n = 13), accidental dislodgement (12%, n = 7), and dressing disruption (11%, n = 6) were the commonest complications observed. Documentation regarding catheter care practices occurred in 41% of cases. CONCLUSION: Quality improvement efforts that seek to benchmark practice, identify gaps, and institute efforts to improve PICC care and practice in SNFs appear necessary.

36352414,2022,Lower risk of bloodstream infections for peripherally inserted central catheters compared to central venous catheters in critically ill patients. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) serve as an alternative to short-term central venous catheters (CVCs) for providing intravenous access in hospitalized patients. Although a number of studies suggest that PICCs are associated with a lower risk of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) than CVCs, recent data concerning specific patient groups support the contrary. In this regard, we are comparing CVC- and PICC-related CLABSI rates developed in a selected group of critically ill inpatients and evaluating the CLABSI microbiological distribution. METHODS: The study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Greece between May 2017 and May 2019. We performed a two-year retrospective analysis of the data collected from medical records of consecutive adult patients who underwent PICC or CVC placement. RESULTS: A total of 1187 CVCs placed for 9774 catheter-days and 639 PICCs placed for 11,110 catheter-days, were reported and analyzed during the study period. Among CVCs, a total of 59 (4.9%) CLABSIs were identified, while among PICCs, 18 (2.8%) cases presented CLABSI (p = 0.029). The CLABSI incidence rate per 1,000 catheter-days was 6.03 for CVC group and 1.62 for PICC group (p < 0.001). The CLABSI rate due to multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) among the two groups was 3.17 in CVC group and 0.36 in PICC group (p < 0.001). Within CLABSI-CVC group, the most common microorganism detected was MDR Acinetobacter baumannii (27.1%) followed by MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae (22%). In CLABSI-PICC group, the predominant microorganism was Candida spp. (33.3%) followed by non-MDR gram-negative pathogens (22.2%). CONCLUSIONS: PICC lines were associated with significantly lower CLABSI rates comparing to CVC although they were in place longer than CVC lines. Given their longer time to the development of infection, PICCs may be a safer alternative for prolonged inpatient IV access. The high prevalence of CLABSI-MDROs depicts the local microbial ecology, emphasizing the need of public health awareness.

We evaluated the difference in thrombosis risk between PICCs and centrally inserted central venous catheters (CICVCs). METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, randomized controlled trial of critically ill adult neurologic patients admitted to neurological and trauma critical care units at two level I trauma centers. Patients were randomized to receive either a PICC or CICVC and undergo active surveillance for CRLVT or death within 15 days of catheter placement. RESULTS: In total, 39 subjects received a PICC and 41 received a CICVC between February 2012 and July 2015. The trial was stopped after enrollment of 80 subjects due to feasibility affected by slow enrollment and funding. In the primary intention-to-treat analysis, 17 (43.6 %) subjects that received a PICC compared to 9 (22.0 %) that received a CICVC experienced the composite of CRLVT or death, with a risk difference of 21.6 % (95 % CI 1.57-41.71 %). Adjusted common odds ratio of CRLVT/death was significantly higher among subjects randomized to receive a PICC (adjusted OR 3.08; 95 % CI 1.1-8.65). The higher adjusted odds ratio was driven by risk of CRLVT, which was higher in those randomized to PICC compared to CICVC (adjusted OR 4.66; 95 % CI 1.3-16.76) due to increased large vein thrombosis without a reduction in proximal deep venous thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our trial demonstrates that critically ill neurologic patients who require a central venous catheter have significantly lower odds of ultrasound-diagnosed CRLVT with placement of a CICVC as compared to a PICC.

METHODS: We implemented an abbreviated training in ultrasound-guided peripheral intravenous catheter placement for nurses on an inpatient medical unit and provided a portable ultrasound device for 10 months. RESULTS: Nurses on this unit placed 99 ultrasound-guided peripheral intravenous catheters with a high level of success. During the implementation period, PICC and midline catheter placement decreased from a mean 4.8 to 2.5 per month, meeting criteria for special cause variation. In the postimplementation period, the average catheter use reverted to 4.3 per month on the intervention unit. A comparison inpatient medical unit without training or access to a portable ultrasound device experienced no significant change in PICC and midline catheter use throughout the study period (mean of 6.0 per month). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that an abbreviated training in ultrasound-guided peripheral intravenous catheter placement for nurses on an inpatient medical unit is sufficient to reduce PICC and midline catheters.

28936124,2017,The risk of venous thromboembolism associated with peripherally inserted central catheters in ambulant cancer patients. ,"BACKGROUND: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common complication of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs). PICCs are increasingly utilised in the management of cancer patients, a group which carries both additional risks for vascular thromboembolism as well as for complex morbidity. We analysed a cohort of cancer patients subjected to PICC insertion in a single cancer centre for the incidence of all-type vascular thromboembolism (VTE) and investigated relative risk factors. METHODS: In this clinical audit, the records of patients referred for PICC insertion in our centre in the period between 1/1/2011 and 1/4/2014 were retrospectively reviewed. The primary outcomes investigated were a) PICC-related deep vein thrombosis (PRDVT) and b) distant VTE (lower limb DVT and pulmonary embolism). 4Fr single lumen PICCs were placed in all patients. The Kaplan Meier method was used to study time from PICC insertion to PRDVT/VTE. Survival curves were compared using the log rank method. Logistic and Cox regression analyses were used to assess local, distant and combined endpoints. RESULTS: Four hundred ninety patients were included in the analysis of which 27 (5.5%) developed a PRDVT. Statistically significant risk factors for developing PRDVT in multivariate analysis included more than one attempt for insertion (OR 2.61, 95%CI: 1.12-6.05) and the use of fluoropyrimidine containing chemotherapy (OR 4.27, 95%CI 1.3-14.07). Twenty-six patients developed a distant VTE. Male gender was the only significant risk factor for distant VTE. When all-type VTE were considered together fluoropyrimidine containing chemotherapy (OR 4.54, 95% CI 1.63-12.61), male gender (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.04-3.93) and white cell count (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.00-1.26) were statistically significant as risk factors in this analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This is a large study of VTE following PICC insertion in cancer patients which also looks at the rate of distant VTE. The observed PRDVT incidence is comparable with available literature. Fluoropyrimidine containing chemotherapy and more than one attempt for PICC insertion were independent predictors of PICC-associated VTE whilst the former remained an independent predictor of all-type VTE.

24292900,2014,Risk factors of radiation dose in patients undergoing peripherally-inserted central catheter procedure using conventional angiography equipment and flat panel detector-based mobile C-arm fluoroscopy. ,"BACKGROUND: Although peripherally-inserted central catheter (PICC) insertion is commonly performed under fluoroscopic guidance, few reports have addressed performance and dosimetry when PICC is inserted under C-arm fluoroscopy. PURPOSE: To evaluate the risk factors of radiation dose in performing PICC insertion using flat panel detector-based mobile C-arm fluoroscopy and a conventional angiography machine. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety-eight patients underwent the PICC procedure using conventional angiography equipment (n=49) or flat panel detector-based mobile C-arm fluoroscopy (n=49). Data were prospectively analyzed from July to November 2012. Dose-area product (DAP), tube voltage, tube current, fluoroscopy time, and image quality measured on a 5-point scale were estimated and compared using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in tube voltage, fluoroscopy time, and image quality between conventional angiography and mobile C-arm fluoroscopy. DAP, mean arm tube current, and tube current in chest fluoroscopy were significantly lower in mobile C-arm fluoroscopy than using the conventional angiography machine (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis identified tube current in chest fluoroscopy, arm tube current, and fluoroscopy equipment as significant risk factors for elevated radiation dose in PICC insertion. CONCLUSION: PICC insertion can be performed using flat panel detector-based mobile C-arm fluoroscopy instead of a conventional angiography machine. Image quality and fluoroscopy time were not different between the two systems and the use of C-arm fluoroscopy significantly reduced radiation dose.

34313170,2023,Catheterization of PICC through a superficial femoral vein for patients with superior vena cava syndrome using ECG positioning and ultrasound-guided technologies. ,"OBJECTIVE: We herein demonstrate the efficacy of PICC placement through a superficial femoral vein in patients with superior vena cava syndrome using ultrasound guidance and electrocardiographic localization. The treatment of PICC disconnection was also discussed. METHODS: The study enrolled 51 patients with superior vena cava syndrome. Ultrasound-guided technology and ECG positioning technology are employed to help these patients in catheterization. The puncture time, the number of punctures, and catheter tip position were recorded. The patient was followed up for at least 2 years. The complications and treatment during follow-up were recorded. RESULT: The average puncture time was 32.13 ± 3.91 min. A total of 49 patients were successfully punctured once, while 2 patients failed in the first puncture. The main reason for puncture failure is that the inability of a guide wire to pass through. After the nurse removed the needle and pressed the puncture point until no rebleeding occurred, the puncture above the original puncture point was successful. X-ray examination revealed that the catheter tip was located in the inferior vena cava, above the diaphragm, near the right atrium. The success rate of catheterization was 100%. The visual analog scale (VAS) score was (2.44 ± 0.73) at the time of puncture, which was tolerable during the operation, and the patient did not complain of obvious pain following the operation. One patient developed complications of broken tube half a year after the puncture. Interventional physicians utilized angiography to locate the broken catheter. CONCLUSION: It is safe and feasible to place PICC through a superficial femoral vein under ultrasound combined with ECG positioning technology in patients with superior vena cava syndrome.

METHODS: A total of 3012 nonmetastatic NPC patients were enrolled in this retrospective study, and we applied Cox regression and log-rank tests to assess the association between PICC-VTE and survival using the propensity score method (PSM) to adjust for gender, age, radiotherapy technique, tumor stage, node stage, UICC clinical stage and pre-treatment EBV DNA. RESULTS: 217 patients developed PICC-VTE, with an incidence of 7.20%. PSM identified 213 patients in the cohort with VTE and 852 in that without. Patients who developed PICC-VTE had a shorter 5-year PFS (77.5% vs 87.6%, p < 0.001), DMFS (85.0% vs 91.2%, p < 0.001), LRRFS (93.9% vs 97.7%, p < 0.001) and OS (85.4% vs 87.6%, p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses indicated that no significant survival difference was found between PICC-related superficial venous thrombosis and deep vein thrombosis, nor did different anticoagulant treatment methods. CONCLUSIONS: PICC-VTE was associated with a worse survival outcome in nonmetastatic NPC patients. A prospective randomized clinical trial is required to verify the results.

35177128,2022,Indwelling time of peripherally inserted central catheters and incidence of bloodstream infections in haematology patients: a cohort study. ,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess whether longer indwelling time of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) increases risk of central line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) in haematology patients. METHODS: Multicentre retrospective cohort study among haematology patients receiving PICCs between 2013 and 2015. Occurrence of CLABSI based on CDC definitions was assessed. We calculated incidence rates, determined risk factors for CLABSI and used Poisson regression models to assess the risk of developing CLABSI as a function of PICC dwell time. We compared diagnoses and treatment characteristics between 2013-2015 and 2015-2020. RESULTS: 455 PICCs placed in 370 patients were included, comprising 19,063 catheter days. Median indwelling time was 26 days (range 0-385) and CLABSI incidence was 4.0 per 1000 catheter days, with a median time to CLABSI of 33 days (range 18-158). Aplastic anaemia (AA) was associated with an increased risk of CLABSI; patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) were less likely to develop CLABSI. In the unadjusted analysis, PICCs with an indwelling time of 15-28 days, 29-42 days, 43-56 days and > 56 days each had an increased CLABSI incidence rate ratio of 2.4 (1.2-4.8), 2.2 (0.95-5.0), 3.4 (1.6-7.5) and 1.7 (0.9-3.5), respectively, compared to PICCs in place for < 15 days. However, after adjusting for AA and SCT, there was no significant difference in incidence rates between dwell times (p 0.067). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that risk of CLABSI does not appear to increase with longer PICC indwelling time. Routine replacement of PICCs therefore is unlikely to prevent CLABSI in this population.

31721153,2020,Cost analysis comparison between peripherally inserted central catheters and implanted chest ports in patients with cancer-A health economic evaluation of the PICCPORT trial. ,"BACKGROUND: A reliable central venous access device is a cornerstone in the treatment of cancer. Both peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) and totally implanted chest ports (PORT) are commonly used for the delivery of chemotherapy. Both types of catheter can cause adverse events such as catheter-related deep venous thrombosis (CR-DVT), infection and mechanical complications. METHOD: We conducted a randomized controlled trial including 399 patients with cancer and performed a health economic evaluation investigating the cost related to PICCs and PORTs using several clinically relevant dimensions from a healthcare perspective. The cost was determined using process and cost estimate models. RESULT: PICCs are associated with a higher total cost when compared with PORTs. Combining the costs of all categories, the prize per inserted device was 824.58 EUR for PICC and 662.34 EUR for PORT. When adjusting for total catheter dwell time the price was 6.58 EUR/day for PICC and 3.01 EUR/day for PORT. The difference in CR-DVT was the main contributor to the difference in cost. The daily cost of PICC is approximately twice to that of PORT. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that the cost from a healthcare perspective is higher in cancer patients receiving a PICC than to those with a PORT. The difference is driven mainly by the cost related to the management of adverse events. Our findings are relevant to anaesthetists, oncologists and vascular access clinicians and should be considered when choosing vascular access device prior to chemotherapy.

37046808,2023,Intravascular Complications of Central Venous Catheterization by Insertion Site in Acute Leukemia during Remission Induction Chemotherapy Phase: Lower Risk with Peripherally Inserted Catheters in a Single-Center Retrospective Study. ,"The basilic/brachial (BBV), internal jugular (IJV), and subclavian veins (SCV) are commonly used as central venous catheter (CVC) sites. A BBV approach [peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)] is increasingly used for short- to intermediate-term CVCs for acute leukemias undergoing cytotoxic intensive regimens. In this retrospective study, the catheterization of the BBV, IJV, and SCV in patients with previously untreated acute leukemia was assessed. The primary outcome was the composite incidence of catheter-related symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis (sDVT) and bloodstream infection (BSI) from catheterization up to 30 days later. In a 10-year period, 336 CVC were inserted in the BBV (n = 115), IJV (n = 111), and SCV (n = 110) in 336 patients suffering from AML (n = 201) and ALL (n = 135) and undergoing induction chemotherapy. The primary outcome events were 8, 20, and 27 in the BBV, SCV and IJV cohorts (2.6, 6.9, and 9.6 per 1000 catheter-days, respectively; p = 0.002). The primary outcome risk was significantly higher in the IJV-cohort than in the BBV-cohort (HR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.6 to 7.9; p = 0.001) and in the SCV-cohort than in the BBV-cohort (HR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2 to 5.9; p = 0.02).

DESIGN: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 348 cancer patients with PICCs who were admitted to the Department of Oncology of West China Hospital, over a 1-year period, between February 1, 2016, and February 31, 2017. We obtained the clinical attributes, onset, duration, and outcome of thrombosis from electronic health records. We assigned all patients to either the training or testing set, and used four models for comparison with the currently used criteria. RESULTS: ML methods showed good efficiency in PICC-related thrombosis risk assessment (with areas under the curve of 0.7733, 0.7869, 0.7833, and 0.7717 respectively) and outperform the currently used criteria (Seeley), which did not identify any positive case. CONCLUSIONS: Our research confirmed that ML approaches are powerful tools to identify cancer patients with a high risk of PICC-related thrombosis, which outperform the currently used criteria (Seeley). Moreover, our research also offers some indications on the predictors and risk factors of PICC-related thrombosis. From our research, more-precise assessments can be performed in cancer patients with PICCs to help decide the prophylaxis and effectively lower the incidence of PICC-related thrombosis.

24781722,2014,Thrombotic risk factors in patients undergoing chemotherapy via peripherally inserted central catheter. ,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate risk factors for venous thrombosis in patients undergoing chemotherapy via peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC). METHODS: Data regarding age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking history, diagnosis, medical history, family history of thrombosis, haemoglobin level, and white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts were prospectively collected from consecutively recruited patients. Patients were evaluated using six thrombotic risk-assessment scales prior to PICC. Assessments of the general venous system and the catheterized vein and limb were made. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was diagnosed by colour Doppler ultrasonography. Thrombosis risk factors were identified by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Thrombosis occurred in 12/188 patients (6.38%). Age >60 years, BMI >25 kg/m(2) and WBC >11.4 × 10(9)/l were identified as independent risk factors for thrombosis. The incidence of thrombosis was 16.6% (12/72) in patients with one or more risk factors, and 55.5% (five of nine) in those with two or more risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Age >60 years, BMI >25 kg/m(2) and WBC >1.4 × 10(9)/l are major risk factors for thrombosis in Chinese patients undergoing PICC chemotherapy.

METHODS: A total of 720 hospitalized patients undergoing first PICC were assigned to treatment and control groups (360 cases each group) according to a random number table. The control group received conventional catheterization and nursing care. The treatment group was first given hot compress with CHSP (which consisted of honeysuckle 30 g, Semen brassicae 30 g, Salvia miltiorrhiza 30 g, Angelica dahurica 30 g, Semen raphani 30 g, Evodia rutaecarpa 30 g, and coarse salt 20 g) on the punctured vessel under aseptic conditions for 5-10 min before conventional catheterization. The main efficacy indices were the vessel diameters before and during catheterization and the success rate of a single catheter, and the secondary efficacy indiex was the incidence of superficial phlebitis within 1 week after catheterization. RESULTS: The vessel diameter during catheterization of the treatment group was remarkably increased compared with the control group [(7.96±0.42) mm vs. (4.39±0.54) mm, P<0.01]. The success rate of the single catheter of the treatment group was significantly higher than that of the control group [94.00% (329/350) vs. 73.72% (244/329), P<0.01]. The incidence of superficial phlebitis within 1 week after catheterization in the treatment group was lower than that in the control group (P=0.007). There was no adverse event with CHSP. CONCLUSION: Hot compress with CHSP during PICC is applicable as it can effectively improve the success rate of a single catheter and reduce the incidence of superficial phlebitis after catheterization (Trial registration No. ChiCTR-ONC-17010498).

24261003,2013,Patients' experiences of the PICC insertion procedure. ,"Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are a type of central venous access device used to deliver a variety of intravenous therapies, including chemotherapy. PICCs may be placed by interventional radiologists, anaesthetists or, as is increasingly common, by specialist nurses in the hospital setting. However, little is known about how patients feel regarding the PICC insertion procedure. The aim of this study was to interview patients who had undergone a recent PICC insertion in the chemotherapy day unit to identify their experiences. On analysis of the qualitative data obtained from the semi-structured interview, five themes emerged: the context of cancer; expectations; levels of pain and anxiety; coping strategies; and explanation. The findings of this study support some previously described elements of procedural experiences; however, new understanding has provided implications for practice in the areas of expectations, allaying anxiety levels, supporting individual coping strategies and providing explanation. The major limitation of the study was the homogenous sample of oncology patients with a clear link between the patient experience of the PICC insertion and the context of cancer. The main recommendation for further research would be to repeat this study with a broader patient population. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Adaptation, Psychological'

30384035,2018,Comparative thrombosis risk of vascular access devices among critically ill medical patients. ,"BACKGROUND: Central venous catheters (CVC) and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are central vascular access devices (CVADs) that facilitate administration of medications among critically ill patients. Both are associated with risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The relative risk of VTE between these catheter types is not well defined. We report the rate of VTE in intensive care unit (ICU) medical patients receiving PICC, CVC, both, or neither. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study of medical-ICU patients between November 2007 and November 2013 grouped by receipt of CVC, PICC, both, or neither. The primary outcome was the rate of 30-day symptomatic venous thrombosis (upper and lower deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism). Cox modeling was used to analyze this population and adjust for comorbidities which could contribute to VTE. Secondary outcomes included VTE location, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality among patients with and without CVADs. RESULTS: We analyzed 5788 patients. CVADs were placed in 2403 (42%) patients (PICC, n = 816; CVC, n = 1153; both, n = 434). Compared with no CVAD, the hazard ratio (HR) for 30-day VTE was 1.81 (95% CI 1.52-2.17) for any CVAD, 1.90 (95% CI 1.52-2.37) for PICC, 1.57 (95% CI 1.26-1.96) for CVC, and 2.70 (95% CI 2.09-3.47) for both. PICCs had a non-significantly higher HR for VTE compared with CVC (1.21; 95% CI 0.94-1.55). For patients with both a CVC and PICC the HR for VTE was 1.72 times that of solitary CVAD (95% CI 1.32-2.23). CONCLUSIONS: Among critically ill medical patients, PICCs and CVCs were associated with increased risk of VTE. Placement of both conferred higher risk of VTE compared with either alone.

36845901,2022,An observational study on the use of long acting buprenorphine (Sublocade) and a Tamper resistant PICC for Outpatient IV antibiotic administration in Patients with serious infections and Opioid Use Disorder; The STOP OUD project. ,"WHAT IS STOP OUD? The STOP OUD project is an observational study on the use of long-acting buprenorphine (Sublocade) and a Tamper resistant PICC clamp for Outpatient IV antibiotic administration in Patients with serious infections and Opioid Use Disorder (STOP OUD). BACKGROUND: The US opioid crisis is driving up serious infections related to intravenous drug use. These infections require prolonged courses of antibiotics, often resulting in lengthy hospital stays. Extended hospitalizations for monitored parenteral antibiotics for patients with opioid use disorder are challenging for patients, reduce bed capacity, and are associated with significant cost. This observational study reviews the administration of intravenous (IV) antibiotics in a monitored outpatient setting using long-acting injectable buprenorphine (Sublocade, Indivior Inc., North Chesterfield, VA) and a tamper resistant clamp in patients with opioid use disorder . METHODS: Long-acting buprenorphine and a tamper resistant clamp were used to treat patients with serious infections and opioid use disorder as outpatients. RESULTS: Hospital days avoided were 30-days per STOP OUD project participant. Eleven of thirteen STOP OUD project participants completed their antibiotic courses as prescribed, there was no evidence of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) tampering, and they rated their care as a mean of 4.9/5 (SD 0.4). Institutional savings per STOP OUD patient was $33,000. Outpatient infusion costs were $9,300 for a net savings of $23,700 per STOP OUD project participant. Infections resolved in all participants. CONCLUSIONS: The STOP OUD project reduced hospital length of stay for patients with opioid use disorder and serious infections, and had a favorable financial impact.

28218360,2017,"Evaluating safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of PICC securement by subcutaneously anchored stabilization device. ","PURPOSE: In recent years, a large variety of medical devices has become available. Every device must be efficient, safe and cost effective, but it is not enough to use it properly without considering the environment in which it will be employed. We applied this kind of analysis to subcutaneously anchored sutureless devices (SAS). METHODS: This is a one-center prospective observational study on safety, effectiveness and cost effectiveness of an SAS device (SecurAcath, Interrad) for securement of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) in 30 adult cancer patients with treatment expected to be >60 days. RESULTS: During 4963 catheter days and after 709 dressing changes (documented by 373 pictures), the use of SAS was associated with no episode of PICC dislodgement and a lower incidence of complications if compared to traditional securement devices. Insertion, management and removal of SAS were not associated with an increased pain perception by the patients. Cost effectiveness was particularly evident for long dwelling PICCs. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that SAS is a highly effective and cost-effective method for securement of medium- to long-term PICCs with expected duration longer than 30 days. The introduction of SAS had a positive impact on our healthcare organization. ",['eng'],['Journal Article' 'Observational Study'],"['Administration, Intravenous'

26113804,2015,Retrospective cohort analysis comparing the incidence of deep vein thromboses between peripherally-inserted and long-term skin tunneled venous catheters in hemato-oncology patients. ,"BACKGROUND: The introduction of central venous catheters has advanced medical care, particularly in hemato-oncology. However these can be associated with an increased thrombotic risk. Previous studies have compared the rate of thrombotic events between peripherally- inserted (PICCs) and long term skin tunneled catheters (LTSTCs) noting fewer complications associated with the latter, though this has rarely translated into clinical practice. The objectives of our study was to compare the cumulative incidence of thrombotic events between peripherally-inserted and long term skin tunneled venous catheters. PATIENTS/METHODS: We performed a retrospective, single center cohort analysis of patients with hematological malignancies who had either a PICC or LTSTC line inserted between January 2010 through January 2013. Cumulative incidences of thrombotic events were compared between the two groups, and post-thrombotic complications were also examined. RESULTS: 346 patients had a PICC inserted with cumulative incidence of symptomatic thrombosis of 5.8%, while 237 patients had a LTSTC inserted with a cumulative incidence of 1.7% (p = 0.003). Post-thrombotic complication rates, particularly infection, were higher in the PICC group compared to the LTSTC group (p = 0.597). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the incidence of thrombotic events in hemato-oncology patients was significantly lower in those who had a LTSTC compared to PICC line. As the use of central venous lines increases in hemato-oncology patient care, a randomized trial comparing PICCs and LTSTCs is necessary to address which venous access is most appropriate in this cohort of patients, with minimal risk of morbidity and mortality.

33752491,2022,New formulas to predict the length of a peripherally inserted central catheter based on anteroposterior chest radiographs. ,"PURPOSE: To develop formulas that predict the optimal length of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) from variables measured on anteroposterior (AP) chest radiography (CXR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 134 patients who underwent PICC insertion at the angiography suites were included. Clinical information such as patient height, weight, sex, age, cubital crease to inferior carina border length (CCL), and approach side were recorded. The following variables via measurement on AP-CXR were also collected: (1) distance from the T1 to T12 vertebra (DTV), (2) maximal horizontal thoracic diameter (MHTD), and (3) clavicle length (CL). RESULTS: Significant correlations between CCL and the following variables were identified in linear regression analyses: approach side, height, weight, sex, DTV, MHTD, and CL. Multiple regression results motivated the following two formulas: (1) with height data, estimated CCL (cm) = 12.429 + 0.113 × Height + 0.377 × MHTD (if left side, add 2.933 cm, if female, subtract 0.723 cm); (2) without height data, estimated CCL = 19.409 + 0.424 × MHTD + 0.287 × CL + 0.203 × DTV (if left side, add 3.063 cm, if female, subtract 0.997 cm). Estimated final PICC length can be calculated as (Estimated CCL, cm) + 4.0 (distance from inferior carina border to about 2.0 vertebra body unit, cm) - (distance from set cubital crease to designated puncture point, cm). CONCLUSION: This study suggests new formulas to predict the appropriate PICC length for bedside insertion using previous AP-CXRs. With this formula, ideal positioning of the catheter's tip can be achieved in the clinical practice, avoiding or minimalizing the exposed catheter out of skin. These formulas may be helpful for patients who cannot undergo intra-hospital transport due to hemodynamic instability or who are concerned about isolation precautions due to any infectious-related contamination.

37087416,2023,A comparative study between two methods of delivery of chemotherapeutic agent in patients with bone and soft tissue sarcoma of lower extremity. ,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to compare the effects of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) and implantable venous access devices (TIVADs) in terms of complications and shoulder function in patients with malignant bone and soft tissue tumors of the lower extremities. METHODS: We analyzed 65 cases of TIVADs (chest wall) and 65 cases of PICC at the orthopedic department of the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University between June 2019 and December 2021, which were diagnosed with malignant bone tumors or soft tissue tumors of the lower extremities (tumors had to be relatively sensitive to chemotherapy), received regular chemotherapy, with ≥ 14 cycles (42 weeks). The two groups were compared in terms of catheter indwelling time, catheter-related complications, Constant-Murley shoulder function score, and displacement of the position of the catheter end on the catheterization side. RESULTS: Compared to the PICC group, at six months after catheterization, the TIVADs group reported better outcomes for catheter indwelling time, catheter-related complications, and Constant-Murley score for the catheterization-side shoulder joint (p < 0.05). The TIVADs group also reported less displacement of the catheter end position after 180° abduction of the catheterization-side shoulder joint (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with PICC, TIVADs can prolong catheter indwelling time, reduce catheter-related complications, and maintain shoulder joint function, which makes it an ideal venous-access approach when providing chemotherapy to patients with malignant bone and soft tissue tumors of the lower extremities.

A number of patient-related, clinical-related and device-related characteristics might be risk factors for PICC-related thrombosis. We retrospectively reviewed a database of 320 consecutive patients who underwent PICC insertion between December 2014 and December 2015 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University to explore the potential associations between risk factors and PICC-associated thrombosis. A novel nomogram for predicting risk was developed based on the data. The nomogram prediction model included ten risk factors that were derived from different relevant estimates. The nomogram prediction model showed good discriminatory power (Harrell's C-index, 0.709) and a high degree of similarity to actual thrombosis occurring after calibration. Furthermore, principal component analysis was performed to identify the factors that most influence PICC-related thrombosis. Our novel nomogram thrombosis risk prediction model was accurate in predicting PICC-related thrombosis. Karnofsky performance scores, D-dimer and blood platelet levels and previous chemotherapy were principal components. Our findings might help clinicians predict thrombosis risk in individual patients, select proper therapeutic strategies and optimize the timing of anticoagulation therapy.

Patient and system factors that increase risk of complications should be identified to avoid preventable patient harm. METHODS: A case control analysis of adult inpatients who underwent PICC placement from January 2009 to January 2010 at Scott & White Memorial Hospital was conducted to determine the incidence and risk factors for complications. One hundred seventy cases of inpatients who experienced PICC-related complications were identified. Age- and gender-matched controls were randomly selected among patients who underwent PICC placement without documented complications during this time. RESULTS: A total of 1444 PICCs were placed, with a complication rate of 11.77% (95% confidence interval: 10.11%-13.44%). Complications included catheter-associated thrombosis (3%), mechanical complications (4%), catheter-associated bloodstream infections (2%), and cellulitis (1%). In multivariable logistic regression analyses, malnutrition and after-hours placement were significantly associated with increased risk of complications, as was body mass index (BMI) >30 after adjusting for anticoagulation and time of placement. In a secondary multivariable logistic regression analysis, after-hours placement and malnutrition were significantly associated with increased risk of nonmechanical complications. Additionally, in conditional univariate analyses, length of stay, malnutrition, and after-hours placement were associated with increased risk of catheter-associated thrombosis. In our multivariable logistic regression analyses, use of anticoagulation/antiplatelet agents was associated with decreased risk of all-cause complications, nonmechanical complications, and catheter-associated thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Screening of patients undergoing PICC placement with attention to malnutrition, BMI >30, and length of stay may reduce the risk of PICC-associated complications. Use of anticoagulation/antiplatelet agents and avoiding after-hours placement may reduce complications and enhance patient safety.

31981040,2020,PICC-related upper deep venous thrombosis in patients with hematological malignancies. Management of anticoagulant therapy according to the platelet count. ,"Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) for central venous access are frequently used in patients with hematological malignancies. Their use may be complicated by upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (UEDVT). Additionally, hematological patients are frequently thrombocytopenic and the optimal management of UEDVT in patients with thrombocytopenia is challenging and poorly standardized. We retrospectively analyzed 50 adult patients affected by hematological malignancies who presented a PICC-associated UEDVT. UEDVT treatment was compared in 3 groups: patients with a platelet count ≥ 50 × 10(9)/l (group1) who underwent a therapeutic dose of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux 7.5 mg; patients with a platelet count < 50 × 10(9)/l and ≥ 30 × 10(9)/l (group 2) who were treated with a 50% reduced dose of LMWH or fondaparinux 5 mg; patients with platelets < 30 × 10(9)/l (group 3) were observed and treated with anticoagulants when the count was > 30 × 10(9)//l. At the onset of thrombosis, 36 patients were in group 1, 8 in group 2 and 6 in group 3. We observed no hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications related to the anticoagulant therapy; length of treatment was comparable between groups 1 and 2 (51 days group 1 vs 50 days group 2). Reduced doses of LMWH or fondaparinux may represent a safe and effective therapeutic approach in patients with moderate thrombocytopenia (< 50 × 10(9)/l and ≥ 30 × 10(9)/l) and a PICC-associated UEDVT.

28540264,2017,Analysis of Risk Factors of Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter Induced Catheter-related Infection in Patients with Leukemia. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) is commonly used in nursing for patients with leukemia. The purpose of this study was to investigate the risk factors of Catheter-related infection (CRI) in patients with leukemia and to provide some nursing strategies based on the results. METHODS: Clinical data from 140 patients with leukemia between May 2014 and July 2016 in Haiyang People's Hospital, China were retrospectively analyzed. We employed univariate analysis to explore the relationship of various factors, including leukemia types, puncture times, underlying diseases, Catheter indwelling time, hormones use, chemotherapy use, immune functions and seasons, with the incidence of CRI. Further, multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the potential independent risk factors of CRI. Bacterial culture was performed for etiological detection. RESULTS: Among the 140 patients with leukemia, 25 cases were diagnosed as CRI, with the incidence of 17.9%. Univariate analysis showed that puncture times, underlying diseases, catheter indwelling time, hormones use, chemotherapy use, immune functions and seasons were significantly correlated with the incidence of CRI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that immune functions, puncture times and seasons were independent risk factors for CRI. Etiological bacterial culture detected 20 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus: n=10, Klebsiella pneumonia: n=4, Coryne-bacterium: n=2 and other species: n=4) in 25 cases diagnosed with CRI. CONCLUSION: Based on risk factors of CRI and its etiological distribution, appropriate nursing measures can be taken to reduce the incidence of CRI in patients with leukemia.

Novel antibiotics which are effective against resistant strains and unlikely to elicit strong resistance are sought after in these settings. We have previously developed synthetic mimics of ubiquitous antimicrobial peptides and have worked to apply a lead compound, CSA-131, to the crisis. We aimed to generate a system of CSA-131-containing coatings for medical devices that can be adjusted to match elution and compound load for various environments and establish their efficacy in preventing the growth of common pathogens in and around these devices. Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines were selected for our substrate in this work, and a polyurethane-based system was used to establish coatings for evaluation. Microbial challenges by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Candida albicans were performed and SEM was used to evaluate coating structure and colonization. The results indicate that selected coatings show activity against selected planktonic pathogens that extend between 16 and 33 days, with similar periods of biofilm prevention.

30035806,2019,Rate of Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infections Between Tunneled Central Venous Catheters Versus Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters in Adult Home Parenteral Nutrition: A Meta-analysis. ,"BACKGROUND: Tunneled central venous catheters (TCVCs) and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) are often used for the provision of home parenteral nutrition (HPN). There is no formal comparison being made to study the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) between TCVCs and PICC in HPN to recommend the use of 1 over the other. METHODS: An online MEDLINE, PubMed, and Scopus search was conducted. Studies reporting the rate of CRBSI in HPN patients were included. DerSimonian and Laird random effects meta-analyses were used to analyze comparative studies, whereas Begg and Pilote's random effects meta-analysis was used to pool and analyze single-arm studies. RESULTS: Seventeen studies (12 single-arm studies and 5 comparative studies) were included for analysis. Meta-analysis of comparative studies showed that PICC use was associated with a significantly lower rate of CRBSI (relative risk (RR) 0.40, 95% CI 0.19-0.83), whereas meta-analysis of single-arm studies revealed that the relative risk for CRBSI was not statistically significantly different from unity. CONCLUSION: TCVC is more commonly used in long-term HPN. Our analysis of comparative studies showed a lower rate of CRBSI in HPN patients using PICC compared with TCVC; however, analysis of single-arm studies showed that the rate of CRBSI was comparable in PICC and TCVC use. The decision to which type of catheter is most suited for HPN patients should hence be based on the duration of treatment, level of care, patients' dexterity, as well patients' underlying comorbidities that may potentially contribute to other catheter-related complications.

METHODS: This study included a total of 252 patients with chest tumors with PICC placement who were treated from March 2018 to December 2021 in a tertiary hospital in Shanghai, China. Investigators used univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression to identify the risk factors. RESULTS: Among the included patients, 40.8% had skin injuries (n = 103). Skin injury occurred between 2 and 361 days after PICC placement, with a median time of 56.0 days (interquartile range, 20.75-99.25 days). Skin injury may occur during catheter retention and be concentrated in the first 3 months after PICC placement; the occurrence trajectory of skin injury exhibits a downward trend. Logistic regression analysis shows that skin injury is more likely to occur if the patient has a history of smoking, allergy history, use of recombinant human endostatin, or an excessive duration of catheter retention. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of PICC-related skin injury in patients with chest tumors remains high. Medical practitioners should be aware of its characteristics and risk factors and adopt effective solutions early to mitigate the occurrence of skin injury and improve patients' safety.

Here, we assessed the clinical course of elderly patients with dementia using PICCs. Methods: This retrospective observational study was conducted at a single dementia treatment center. PICCs were used in elderly inpatients with dementia who required (a) intravenous therapy, supplemental parenteral nutrition, and dysphagia rehabilitation during acute illness; (b) end-of-life care; (c) total parenteral nutrition (TPN); or (d) an alternative to peripheral vascular (PV) access. Results: Fifty-nine patients were enrolled (83.5 ± 6.9 years): 61% were in the acute treatment group, and 17% were in the end-of-life care group. The median catheter lifespan was 42 (23-87.5) days. The incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infection was 0.22 per 1,000 PICC-days, and that of deep venous thrombosis was 0.66 per 1,000 PICC-days. Among the patients in acute treatment group, 19% resumed sufficient oral intake after the treatment using PICC, and 36% resumed oral intake of gelatin-like food. Among the patients in the end-of-life care group, 91% received intravenous fluids continuously until death by initially inserted PICC. Conclusion: In elderly patients with dementia, PICCs might be one of the options during the treatment of acute illness as well as for prolonged support during end-of-life care.

29246189,2017,Colonoscopy overuse in colorectal cancer screening and associated factors in Argentina: a retrospective cohort study. ,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, there has been growing concern about the overuse of colonoscopy (CC). Our objective was to evaluate the incidence rate and cumulative probability of having a potentially inadequate CC (PI-CC, e.g. a CC that was performed earlier that recommended) and the association between the report of a hyperplastic polyp in the baseline CC report and the probability of having a PI-CC. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of adults 50y/o or older with a complete baseline CC between January 1st and December 31st 2005, without reported lesions or with hyperplastic polyps, based on secondary data extracted from the electronic medical record of the Hospital Italiano of Buenos Aires. The outcome consisted of time until a PI-CC, defined as the time measured between basal colonoscopy and a colonoscopy performed earlier than the inter-screening interval recommended by the USPSTF and the USMSTF. RESULTS: 389 patients were included. The cumulative probability of receiving a PI-CC over 10 years was 0.29 (95% CI 0.241, 0.342). The incidence rate resulted in 30.91 PI-CC per 1000 person-years (95% CI 25.14, 38). The crude analysis of the association between the outcome and the presence of hyperplastic polyps in the baseline CC, showed a statistically significant difference between both groups (log rank, p 0.036). The multivariate analysis yielded a hazard ratio of 1.67 (95% CI 1.02-2.73). CONCLUSION: We observed that 3 in every 10 patients treated in our health system received a PI-CC during the first ten consecutive years after a normal complete CC. Furthermore, this could be in part attributed to the presence of a hyperplastic polyp in the baseline CC. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Aged' 'Argentina' 'Colonic Polyps/diagnosis'

It is not known which type of catheter is most at risk of thrombosis. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study the incidence of PORT-related VTE and PICC-related VTE in cancer patients by a meta-analysis. METHODS: A systematic search was performed using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library. Cohort studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PORT-related VTE and PICC-related VTE in cancer patients were included. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort studies. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to calculate odd ratio (OR). Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were conducted. RESULTS: In total, 22 studies comprising 11,940 patients were retrieved. Our meta-analysis of 22 studies suggested that the risk of PORT-related VTE was lower than that of PICC-related VTE in cancer patients (OR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.25-0.58). The subgroup analysis showed that the risk of PORT-related VTE and PICC-related VTE is different in different regions. In the non-Asian countries, PORTs were associated with a decreased risk of VTE compared with PICCs. (OR = 0.41, 95%CI: 0.27-0.61). However, there was no significant difference in the risk of PORT-related VTE and PICC-related VTE in the Asian countries (OR = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.05-1.12). CONCLUSIONS: PORTs are associated with a lower risk of VTE than PICCs in cancer patients. The risk of VTE and benefits should be considered when selecting PORTs or PICCs for cancer patients.

METHODS: 487 patients with gastrointestinal tumors admitted to Qingdao Municipal Hospital from August 2016 to September 2018 were selected and retrospectively analyzed. 279 patients treated with midline catheters during the treatment were regarded as the study group, and another 208 patients treated with PICC were regarded as the control group. The incidence of perioperative adverse reactions, the cost of daily catheter maintenance and the the total cost of catheter indwelling were compared between the two groups. Meanwhile, each patient was investigated for treatment satisfaction at the time of discharge. RESULTS: The total incidence of adverse reactions in the study group was significantly lower than that in the control group (p=0.0001). The catheter indwelling duration in the study group was significantly shorter than that in the control group (p<0.001). The 24-h drainage volume in the study group was significantly higher than that in the control group (p<0.001). The average cost of daily maintenance and total cost of catheter indwelling in the study group were significantly lower than those in the control group (p<0.001). The satisfaction rate in the study group (69.53%) was significantly higher than that in the control group (51.92%) (p<0.001). The dissatisfaction rate in the study group (3.23%) was significantly lower than that in the control group (15.38%) (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Compared with PICC, the perioperative application of midline catheter in patients with gastrointestinal tumors can effectively reduce catheter-related adverse reactions, with higher medical economic benefits and satisfaction rate, and is worthy of clinical promotion and application.

36163680,2022,Should ultrasound evaluation for catheter-related thrombosis always be required before PICC removal? ,"Despite several effective preventive strategies peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs)-as much as centrally inserted central catheters and femorally inserted central catheters-are inevitably associated with the potential development of catheter-related thrombosis. This complication may be symptomatic or-more often-asymptomatic. Even if remote, the chance that PICC removal may mobilize an asymptomatic thrombus and cause pulmonary embolism, is theoretically possible. On the other hand, the diffuse adoption of an ultrasound scan aiming at detecting an asymptomatic catheter-related thrombosis may be logistically difficult and expensive. No clear evidence-based recommendations exist on this issue and whether perform an ultrasound scan before PICC removal in asymptomatic patients remains a matter of debate. For these reasons, the authors propose few common sense recommendations that may help clinicians in weighing the clinical advantages of the exam (optimal safety for the patient) versus its practical disadvantages (logistic cost).

We aimed to describe incidence and types of AEs during exercise for persons undergoing oncological treatment, and associations to exercise intensity, exercise adherence, chemotherapy treatment, initial aerobic fitness. A second aim was to compare incidence of lymphedema, periphery inserted central catheter (PICC) complications, and other new medical conditions (any illness or injury occurred during the exercise trial) between high-intensity vs low-to-moderate exercise and usual care (UC). METHODS: This descriptive, comparative study was based on data from an observational study including patients in an UC setting (n = 90) and a randomized exercise trial (n = 577) in which participants exercised at high-intensity (HI) or low-moderate intensity (LMI). Persons with breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer undergoing neo/adjuvant treatment were included. AEs were reported by exercise coaches, participants, and identified in medical records, as were lymphedema, PICC-complications, and new medical conditions. RESULTS: Coaches reported AEs for 20% of the participants, while 28% of participants self-reported AEs. The most common coach- and participant reported AEs were musculoskeletal and the majority (97%) were considered minor. HI had higher likelihood of AEs than LMI, according to both coaches (OR: 1.9 [95%CI 1.16-3.21], p=.011) and participants (OR: 3.36 [95%CI 2.00-5.62], ≤.001). Lymphedema rates were low (4-9%) and PICC complications ranged from 15% in LMI to 23% in UC and there were no statistically significant differences between HI, LMI, and UC. There were no statistically significant differences between HI and LMI regarding new medical conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise during treatment is safe for these patient groups in this setting, even HI exercise can be recommended if no medical contraindications are present. Similar to healthy populations, a higher risk of having minor AEs when exercising at HI in comparison to LMI may exist.

The databases PubMed, Ovid and the Cochrane library were searched for observational studies pertaining to patient-related risk factors for CVC and PICC-related thrombosis. The initial search through PubMed, Ovid and the Cochrane library yielded 516 results. After 71 duplicates were removed, 445 articles were assessed for eligibility based on title and abstract. Four hundred and eleven articles were then excluded and 33 full text articles were manually assessed for eligibility. Eight articles were eliminated as they did not contain content relevant to the review. Twenty-five studies were then selected to assess 20 risk factors. There were no consistent significant associations for catheter-related thrombosis across the twenty-five studies. Multiple studies identified age, malignancy, diabetes, obesity, chemotherapy, thrombophilia and a history of thrombosis as significant risk factors for catheter-related thrombosis. Inconsistent findings among studies make it difficult to establish which patient-related risk factors are associated with catheter-related thrombosis. Future studies could include larger sample sizes and more cases of catheter-related thrombosis to produce more significant results. Identification of patient-related risk factors could lead to early recognition of upper limb deep vein thrombosis in patients with catheters, thereby preventing complications.

34454607,2021,The curative effect analysis of peripherally inserted central venous catheter catheterization for tumor patients under the guidance of new medical guide wire. ,"OBJECTIVE: To report a method of PICC catheterization with the aid of a new medical guide wire, and to discuss the curative effect. METHODS: Five hundred and thirteen patients who visited our hospital from January 2013 to December 2019 for PICC catheterization were selected as study subjects. Random number method was used to group patients. General information was recorded for both groups. Patients in the observation group received catheterization with the aid of a new medical guide wire. The control group received catheterization via conventional guide wire. The success rate of the first catheterization, the success rate of the catheterization, the timing of the catheterization, the complications and the position of the catheter end were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in general information between the two groups. After analyzing the puncture situation of the two groups, it was found that the average catheterization time of the observation group was shorter than that of the control group, and the difference was statistically significant. Patients in the observation group had higher success rate of one-time catheterization and catheterization success rate, and the difference was statistically significant. The incidences of occult thrombosis, phlebitis and catheter blockage in the observation group were lower than those in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant. The incidence of dominant thrombosis and bleeding at puncture point in the observation group was also lower than that in the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The new type of medical guide wire component is effective for PICC catheterization and worthy of further promotion. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Case-Control Studies'

37736715,2023,Clinical characteristics of peripherally inserted central catheter-related complications in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy: a prospective and observational study. ,"PURPOSE: The incidence of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)-related complications is higher in cancer patients than in noncancer patients. However, the pattern of specific complication occurrence over time remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of PICC-related complications in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. METHODS: This prospective, observational study was conducted at a university-affiliated hospital in Western China. Cancer patients undergoing PICC insertion for anticancer treatment were recruited and followed up until the first week after catheter removal. Any complications, including occurrence time and outcomes, were recorded. The trajectory of specific PICC-related complications over time were identify based on the Kaplan‒Meier curve analysis. RESULTS: Of the 233 patients analyzed, nearly half (n = 112/233, 48.1%) developed 150 PICC-related complication events. The most common were symptomatic catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) (n = 37/233, 15.9%), medical adhesive-related skin injury (MARSI) (n = 27/233, 11.6%), and catheter dislodgement (n = 17/233, 7.3%), accounting for 54.0% (n = 81/150, 54.0%) of total complications events. According to Kaplan‒Meier curve analysis, symptomatic CRT, pain, phlebitis, and insertion site bleeding were classified as the ""early onset"" group mainly occurring within the first month post-insertion. Catheter fracture and catheter-related bloodstream infection were classified as the ""late onset"" group occurring after the second month post-insertion. MARSI, catheter dislodgement, occlusion, and insertion site infection were classified as the ""persistent onset"" group persistently occurring during the whole catheter-dwelling period. Among the 112 patients with PICC-related complications, 50 (44.6%) patients had their catheters removed due to complications, and 62 (55.4%) patients successfully retained their catheters until treatment completion through conventional interventions. The major reasons for unplanned catheter removal were catheter dislodgement (n = 12/233, 5.2%), symptomatic CRT (n = 10/233, 4.3%), and MARSI (n = 7/233, 3.0%), accounting for 58.0% (n = 29/50, 58.0%) of the total unplanned catheter removal cases. Catheter dwelling times between patients with complications under successful interventions (130.5 ± 32.1 days) and patients with no complications (138.2 ± 46.4 days) were not significantly different (t = 1.306, p = 0.194; log-rank test = 2.610, p = 0.106). CONCLUSIONS: PICC-related complications were pretty common in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The time distribution of PICC-related complications varied, and medical staff should develop time-specific protocols for prevention. Because more than half of the patients with PICC-related complications could be managed with conventional interventions, PICCs remain a priority for cancer patients undergoing short-term chemotherapy. The study was registered in 02/08/2019 at Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration number: ChiCTR1900024890).

34951713,2022,Electrocardiographic localization of peripherally inserted central catheter tip position in critically ill patients with advanced cancer: An application study. ,"BACKGROUND: We compared the methods of electrocardiogram (ECG) and X-ray localization of the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) tip position, in order to find a more convenient, practical, and safe method. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the value of applying electrocardiographic localization of the PICC tip position in critically ill patients with advanced cancer in Hebei Province, China. METHOD: Enrolled 137 advanced cancers requiring PICC placement. The position of the catheter tip was localized with the bedside electrocardiogram in real time. Then, the localization was performed using a chest X-ray (the gold standard). The accuracy of electrocardiographic location was checked. RESULTS: Specific P waves were observed in 130 patients. No change in the P waves was observed for the remaining seven patients. The age of the latter group of patients was more advanced (87.29 [5.15] years), a significant difference to that of the 130 patients with specific P waves (71.58 [14.84] years) (t = -6.704, p < .001). Specific P waves not only involve ascendance in P waves but also ascendance in QRS waves. CONCLUSIONS: The use of an ECG to localize the PICC tip in critically ill patients with advanced cancer may replace the unnecessary use of chest X-rays. Specific P waves not only involve an increase in P waves but also an increase in QRS waves. If there is no change in the P wave, a chest X-ray film must be obtained. In elderly patients, because there is a possibility of catheter tip malposition, a comprehensive evaluation should be performed before surgery.

28292637,2017,Patterns and Predictors of Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter Occlusion: The 3P-O Study. ,"PURPOSE: To evaluate patterns and predictors of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)-related occlusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from a multihospital study were used to examine factors associated with PICC occlusion. Occlusion was defined if documented in the medical record or when tissue plasminogen activator was administered for occlusion-related concerns. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to predict occlusion, controlling for patient-, provider-, device-, and hospital-level characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 14,278 PICCs placed in 13,408 patients were included. Of these, occlusion developed in 1,716 PICCs (12%) in 1,684 patients. The most common indications for PICC insertion were intravenous antibiotic therapy (32.7%), difficult intravenous access (21.5%), and central access (13.7%). PICCs placed in the right arm had decreased odds of occlusion compared with those in the left arm (odds ratio [OR] = 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.72-0.94). Verification of catheter tip position following insertion was associated with reduction in occlusion (OR = 0.75; 95% CI = 0.61-0.92). Although normal saline solution or heparin flushes did not reduce occlusion, PICCs flushed with normal saline solution and ""locked"" with heparin were less likely to become occluded (OR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.33-0.88). Compared with single-lumen devices, double- and triple-lumen PICCs were associated with greater incidences of occlusion (double, OR = 3.07; 95% CI = 2.56-3.67; triple, OR = 3.72; 95% CI = 2.92-4.74). Catheter tip malposition was also associated with occlusion (OR = 1.46; 95% CI = 1.14-1.87). CONCLUSIONS: Several patient, provider, and device characteristics appear associated with PICC occlusion. Interventions targeting these factors may prove valuable in reducing this complication. ",['eng'],['Journal Article' 'Multicenter Study'],"['Aged' 'Biomarkers/blood'

32569313,2020,Appropriate duration of peripherally inserted central catheter maintenance to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infection. ,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Prolonged maintenance of central venous catheters, including peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), is a major risk factor for central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). This study was conducted to evaluate the appropriate duration of PICC maintenance to prevent CLABSI. METHODS: A single-center retrospective study was conducted at an 824-bed tertiary hospital in Korea between January 2010 and December 2017. All hospitalized patients who underwent ultrasound-guided PICC insertion were enrolled. CLABSI was diagnosed according to the definitions of the National Health Safety Network. CLABSI caused by PICC was defined as PICC-associated bloodstream infection (PABSI). To identifying statistical correlations between catheter days and PABSI, the odds ratio for PABSI on the basis of the continuous value of catheter days was analyzed using restricted cubic spline splits with five knots. The optimal cut-off value for catheter days was identified by maximizing the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). RESULTS: A total of 1,053 patients underwent ultrasound-guided PICC insertion during the study period. Among them, 36 were confirmed as having a PABSI (3.5%, 36/1014; 1.14 per 1000 catheter days). In the restricted cubic spline regression, catheter days showed a dose-dependent relationship with the risk of PABSI. The AUC of the ROC curve for developing a PABSI according to the duration of catheter maintenance was 0.715 (95% CI, 0.639-0.790); the calculated optimal cut-off value was 25 days. CONCLUSION: The incidence of PABSI was 1.14 per 1000 catheter days and the optimal cut-off value of catheter days to avoid a PABSI was 25 days.

27240799,2016,A comparative evaluation of antimicrobial coated versus nonantimicrobial coated peripherally inserted central catheters on associated outcomes: A randomized controlled trial. ,"BACKGROUND: Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are a common life-threatening risk factor associated with central venous catheters (CVCs). Research has demonstrated benefit in reducing CLABSIs when CVCs coated with antimicrobials are inserted. The impact of chlorhexidine (CHG)-impregnated versus non-CHG peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) on risk of CLABSI is unknown. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is also a complication associated with CVCs. This study compares the impact of both PICC lines on these outcomes. METHODS: Patients in 3 high-risk units were randomly assigned to receive either a CHG-impregnated or non-CHG PICC line. Laboratory data were collected and reviewed daily on all study patients. The PICC dressing site was assessed daily. Medical record documentation was reviewed to determine presence of CLABSI or VTE. RESULTS: There were 167 patients who completed the study. Three patients developed CLABSI (2 in the CHG group, and 1 in the non-CHG group), and 3 patients developed VTE (2 in the non-CHG group, and 1 in the CHG group). No significant relationship was noted between the type of PICC line on development of a CLABSI (P = .61) or VTE (P > .99). A significant difference was noted in moderate bleeding (P ≤ .001) requiring thrombogenic dressing in the patients who had the CHG PICC line. CONCLUSIONS: No differences were noted in the development of CLABSI and VTE between the CHG and non-CHG groups.

29120892,2017,CE: Original Research: Does Certification in Vascular Access Matter? An Analysis of the PICC1 Survey. ,": Background: Although certification by an accredited agency is often a practice prerequisite in health care, it is not required of vascular access specialists who insert peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs). Whether certification is associated with differences in practice among inserters is unknown. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to gather information regarding whether certified and noncertified PICC inserters differ with respect to their practices and views about PICC use. METHODS: We conducted a national survey of vascular access specialists, identifying certified PICC inserters as those who had received board certification from the Association for Vascular Access, the Infusion Nurses Society, or both. The 76-item survey asked about PICC policies and procedures at respondents' facilities, use of insertion technologies, device management, management of complications, perceptions about PICC use, and relationships with other health care providers. Additional data about respondents, including years in practice and primary practice settings, were also gathered. Bivariable comparisons were made using χ tests; two-sided α with P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of the 1,450 respondents in the final sample, 1,007 (69%) said they were certified inserters and 443 (31%) said they were not. Significantly higher percentages of certified than noncertified inserters reported having practiced for five or more years (78% versus 54%) and having placed 1,000 or more PICCs (58% versus 32%). Significantly more certified than noncertified inserters also reported being the vascular access lead for their facility (56% versus 44%). Reported practice patterns for insertion, care, and management of PICCs varied based on certification status. Some evidence-based practices (such as the use of ultrasound to measure catheter-to-vein ratios) were more often reported by certified inserters, while others (such as the use of maximal sterile barriers during PICC insertion) were not. Asked about their perceptions of PICC use at their institution, certified inserters reported higher percentages of inappropriate insertion and removal than noncertified inserters. CONCLUSION: Certified PICC inserters appear to be a distinct group of vascular access specialists. A better understanding of how and why practices differ between certified and noncertified inserters is necessary to ensuring safer, high-quality patient care.

37971792,2023,"Risk Factors and Predictive Models for Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter Unplanned Extubation in Patients With Cancer: Prospective, Machine Learning Study. ","BACKGROUND: Cancer indeed represents a significant public health challenge, and unplanned extubation of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC-UE) is a critical concern in patient safety. Identifying independent risk factors and implementing high-quality assessment tools for early detection in high-risk populations can play a crucial role in reducing the incidence of PICC-UE among patients with cancer. Precise prevention and treatment strategies are essential to improve patient outcomes and safety in clinical settings. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the independent risk factors associated with PICC-UE in patients with cancer and to construct a predictive model tailored to this group, offering a theoretical framework for anticipating and preventing PICC-UE in these patients. METHODS: Prospective data were gathered from January to December 2022, encompassing patients with cancer with PICC at Xiangya Hospital, Central South University. Each patient underwent continuous monitoring until the catheter's removal. The patients were categorized into 2 groups: the UE group (n=3107) and the non-UE group (n=284). Independent risk factors were identified through univariate analysis, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm, and multivariate analysis. Subsequently, the 3391 patients were classified into a train set and a test set in a 7:3 ratio. Utilizing the identified predictors, 3 predictive models were constructed using the logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest algorithms. The ultimate model was selected based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) synthesis analysis. To further validate the model, we gathered prospective data from 600 patients with cancer at the Affiliated Hospital of Qinghai University and Hainan Provincial People's Hospital from June to December 2022. We assessed the model's performance using the area under the curve of the ROC to evaluate differentiation, the calibration curve for calibration capability, and decision curve analysis (DCA) to gauge the model's clinical applicability. RESULTS: Independent risk factors for PICC-UE in patients with cancer were identified, including impaired physical mobility (odds ratio [OR] 2.775, 95% CI 1.951-3.946), diabetes (OR 1.754, 95% CI 1.134-2.712), surgical history (OR 1.734, 95% CI 1.313-2.290), elevated D-dimer concentration (OR 2.376, 95% CI 1.778-3.176), targeted therapy (OR 1.441, 95% CI 1.104-1.881), surgical treatment (OR 1.543, 95% CI 1.152-2.066), and more than 1 catheter puncture (OR 1.715, 95% CI 1.121-2.624). Protective factors were normal BMI (OR 0.449, 95% CI 0.342-0.590), polyurethane catheter material (OR 0.305, 95% CI 0.228-0.408), and valved catheter (OR 0.639, 95% CI 0.480-0.851). The TOPSIS synthesis analysis results showed that in the train set, the composite index (Ci) values were 0.00 for the logistic model, 0.82 for the support vector machine model, and 0.85 for the random forest model. In the test set, the Ci values were 0.00 for the logistic model, 1.00 for the support vector machine model, and 0.81 for the random forest model. The optimal model, constructed based on the support vector machine, was obtained and validated externally. The ROC curve, calibration curve, and DCA curve demonstrated that the model exhibited excellent accuracy, stability, generalizability, and clinical applicability. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this study identified 10 independent risk factors for PICC-UE in patients with cancer. The predictive model developed using the support vector machine algorithm demonstrated excellent clinical applicability and was validated externally, providing valuable support for the early prediction of PICC-UE in patients with cancer.

25616129,2015,Experiences of the first PICC team in the Czech Republic. ,"The first specialist nursing team placing peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in the Czech Republic was established in September 2012. During 2013 the team placed 167 PICCs and 162 midline catheters. In another 6 patients the insertion was not successful. PICCs were inserted mainly for oncology patients; while midline catheters were inserted for patients admitted to general wards. Average duration of catheter insertion was 91 days (range 7-285 days) for PICCs and 14 days (range 2-40 days) for midline catheters. During follow up of PICCs, catheter infection rate was 0.3/1000 days, vein thrombosis rate 0.4/1000 days, catheter occlusion 0.4/1000 days, and catheter displacement 0.33/1000 days. For midline catheters infection rate was 1.4/1000 days, vein thrombosis 5.2/1000 days, catheter occlusion 2.6/1000 days, and catheter displacement 2.2/1000 days.

This study evaluated the routine blood test findings and microbe profiles of bloodstream infection (BSI) by the presence and types of central vein (CV) access devices (CVADs). Methods A total of 878 inpatients at a university hospital who were clinically suspected for BSI and underwent blood culture (BC) testing between April 2020 and September 2020 were enrolled. Data regarding age at BC testing, sex, WBC count, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level, BC test results, yielded microbes, and usage and types of CVADs were evaluated. Results The BC yields were detected in 173 patients (20%), suspected contaminating pathogens in 57 (6.5%), and 648 (74%) with a negative yield. The WBC count (p=0.0882) and CRP level (p=0.2753) did not significantly differ between the 173 patients with BSI and the 648 patients with negative BC yields. Among the 173 patients with BSI, 74 used CVADs and met the diagnosis of CLABSI; 48 had a CV catheter, 16 had CV access ports, and 10 had a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC). Patients with CLABSI showed lower WBC counts (p=0.0082) and serum CRP levels (p=0.0024) compared to those with BSI who did not use CVADs. The most commonly yielded microbes in those with CV catheters, CV-ports, and PICC were Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=9; 19%), Staphylococcus aureus (n=6; 38%), and S. epidermidis (n=8; 80%), respectively. Among those with BSI who did not use CVADs, Escherichia coli (n=31; 31%) was the most common pathogen, followed by S. aureus (n=13; 13%). Conclusion Patients with CLABSI showed lower WBC counts and CRP levels than those with BSI who did not use CVADs. Staphylococcus epidermidis was among the most common microbes in CLABSI and accounted for the majority of yielded microbes in patients who used PICC.

25634150,2015,A comparison of silicone and polyurethane PICC lines and postinsertion complication rates: a systematic review. ,"PURPOSE: To determine postinsertion complication rate for peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), in particular the difference between silicone and polyurethane lines in general population groups as well as oncology and non-oncology patient groups. METHODS: A systematic review of prospective and retrospective studies in the English language between January 2000 and October 2013 focusing on postinsertion complication rates for PICCs in the adult population. Joanna Briggs Institute tools were used to extract data from the final 19 articles with information collated relating to catheter type, patient type, overall complication rate, rates of infection, occlusion, dislodgment, phlebitis, thrombus and rupture. RESULTS: Overall, the PICCs complication rates ranged from 8 to 50%. Although both lines saw similar overall rates upon closer observation, the strengths and weaknesses of both lines are shown.Polyurethane PICC lines were found to provide lower rates of infection, dislodgment, thrombus and rupture complications.Mixed results were found with catheter line occlusions, overall averages showing polyurethane lines slightly higher rates than silicone. Oncology patients however saw opposite results.Phlebitis rates saw the largest division among the postinsertion complication rates, with 6.7% more phlebitis in the general patient group and 14.5% in the oncology group more for those with polyurethane PICC lines compared with the silicone. CONCLUSIONS: Both silicone and polyurethane PICC lines exhibit nearly identical overall average postinsertion compilation rates; however, it is the type of complications experienced that differ. Overall, oncology patients can expect to experience higher levels of postinsertion complications. ",['eng'],['Journal Article' 'Review' 'Systematic Review'],"['Administration, Intravenous'

","BACKGROUND: Centrally inserted totally implanted vascular access ports (PORTs) and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are widely used for the administration of chemotherapy. Our aim was to study the incidence of catheter-related deep venous thrombosis in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy through either a PICC or a PORT. METHODS: Adults with non-haematological cancer (mainly breast and colorectal) from two Swedish oncology centres were included and followed for up to 1 yr. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a single-lumen PICC or PORT. The primary end point was the occurrence of a clinically significant catheter-related deep venous thrombosis, and the secondary end point was a composite of adverse events related to the catheter: insertion complication, thrombosis, occlusion, infection, and mechanical problems. RESULTS: The trial recruited 399 participants (PICC, n=201; PORT, n=198) between March 2013 and February 2017. The PICCs were associated with 16 (8%) deep venous thromboses compared with two (1%) in the PORT group (HR=10.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.3-44.6; P=0.002). The overall incidence of composite adverse events was higher for patients with a PICC compared with those with a PORT (HR=2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-4.6; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: PICCs are associated with higher risk for catheter-related deep venous thrombosis and other adverse events when compared with PORTs. This increased risk should be considered when choosing a vascular access device for chemotherapy, especially in patients with solid malignancy. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01971021.

METHODS: We searched randomized controlled trials and retrospective cohort studies comparing PICCs to PORTs in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Data were extracted from relevant studies. We sought to evaluate procedure time, quality of life and thrombosis [risk ratio (RR) =4.37, 95% CI, 2.10, 9.07, P<0.0001, I2=22%]. Sensitivity analysis and the funnel plot showed that our study was robust and exhibited low publication bias. RESULTS: Ten previous studies were incorporated into this study for a total sample size of 2,585 patients. There was no difference between the PICC and PORT groups in QOL (MD =-1.12, 95% CI, -6.14, 3.91, P=0.66, fixed effect model, I2=32%). PORT required a longer procedure time than the PICC procedure (the overall MD was -5.55 with 95% CI, -6.96, -4.14, I2=0%), and PICCs had more associated complications than PORTs including occlusion (MD =5.42, 95% CI, 2.13, 13.75, P=0.0004, I2=40%) and thrombosis (risk ratio (RR) =4.37, 95% CI, 2.10, 9.07, P<0.0001, I2=22%). Sensitivity analysis and the funnel plot showed that our study was robust and exhibited low publication bias. DISCUSSION: Our study suggested that PORTs had similar clinical effects to PICCs in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. However, PORTs were associated with fewer complications than PICCs.

36203676,2022,Benefits of an online multimodal nursing program among patients with peripherally inserted central catheter-related thrombosis. ,"BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic peripherally inserted central catheter-related thrombosis (PICC-RT) is one of the most common and dangerous complications caused by peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) insertion. A variety of factors might lead to huge psychological pressures on patients and markedly affect their quality of life. The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefits of an online multimodal nursing program on the quality of life and psychological resilience of asymptomatic PICC-RT patients with ovarian cancer. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study on patients with asymptomatic PICC-RT. Patients in the control group received routine nursing care, while patients in the intervention group obtained extra assistance through an online multimodal nursing program. Individual guidance, psychological support, and real-time consultation were provided to patients in the intervention group. All participants were followed for 3 months. The health-related quality of life and psychological resilience of patients were evaluated by using the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), respectively. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, most of the items in the SF-36 scores were significantly increased in both intervention and control groups after 3 months (all p < 0.05), except for the role emotional domain (p = 0.085 in control group). However, the SF-36 scores of the intervention group were significantly higher than those of the control group in All health domains, including physical functioning (p = 0.001), role physical (p = 0.004), bodily pain (p = 0.003), general health (p < 0.001), vitality (p < 0.001), social functioning (p < 0.001), role emotional (p = 0.002), mental health (p < 0.001) and health transition (p < 0.001). For CD-RISC scores, the mean value of the control group was 42.03 ± 4.42 at baseline and increased to 50.36 ± 4.70 after 3 months (p < 0.001), while the intervention group was 40.00 ± 6.61 at baseline and increased to 65.12 ± 5.21 after 3 months (p < 0.001). Moreover, the CD-RISC score in the intervention group was significantly higher than that in the control group after 3 months (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The application of an online multimodal nursing program could significantly improve the health-related quality of life and psychological resilience of asymptomatic PICC-RT patients. These findings provide evidence to support the necessity of an online multimodal nursing program in routine long-term follow-up, especially in the era of COVID-19.

38105233,2023,Risk Factors of Venous Thromboembolism in Inpatients With Colorectal Cancer in China. ,"To explore the risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in inpatients with colorectal cancer. The demographic factors, comorbidities, and hematological indices of patients with colorectal cancer treated in our hospital from 2016 to 2021 were collected and recorded. Venous thromboembolism events, including deep venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism, were recorded and the patients were divided into the VTE group and the non-VTE group. We compared clinical data between the two groups and explored risk factors for VTE. Comparing the clinical data of 293 cases of non-VTE group and 235 cases of VTE group, we found significant differences in age, smoking, temperature, amount of blood loss, differentiation degree, peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC), radiotherapy, anemia, infection, white blood cell count, prothrombin time (PT), PT%, prothrombin ratio, international normalized ratio, thrombin time, CA199 and CEA between the two groups (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that age (P = 0.0444), temperature (P = 0.0317), amount of blood loss (P = 0.0067), PICC (P < 0.0001), chemotherapy (P = 0.0459), anemia (P = 0.0007), international normalized ratio (P = 0.003) and CA199 (p = 0.0234) were independent risk factors for VTE. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the amount of blood loss predicted thrombosis better (AUC = 0.778, P < 0.001), when the cutoff value was 20 mL, the sensitivity was 76.17%, and the specificity was 79.18%, respectively. And PICC predicted thrombosis better (AUC = 0.808, P < 0.001), the sensitivity was 70.21%, and the specificity was 91.47%, respectively. Clinical parameters are associated with VTE in inpatients with colorectal cancer, which will help to guide clinicians to take effective measures to improve the patients' prognosis.

36013377,2022,Central Venous Access and the Risk for Thromboembolic Events in Patients Undergoing Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Radical Cystectomy for Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer. ,"Thromboembolic events (TEE) are high-risk complications in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and radical cystectomy (RC) for urothelial muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). The purpose of the study was to investigate any differences in TEE-incidence, comparing peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) versus a totally implanted port (PORT) as CVA (central venous access) during NAC. We identified 947 cystectomized MIBC-patients from four Swedish medical centers in 2009-2021. Inclusion criteria were cT2-T4aN0M0 and 375 patients were finally eligible and evaluated, divided into: NAC-administered (n = 283) resp. NAC-naïve-NAC-eligible (n = 92), the latter as tentative control group. Data on TEEs and types of CVA were retrospectively collected and individually validated, from final transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TUR-B) to 30 days post-RC. Adjusted logistic regression and log rank test were used for statistical analyses. Amongst NAC-administered, 83% (n = 235) received PICCs and 15% (n = 42) PORTs. Preoperative TEEs occurred in 38 PICC-patients (16.2%) and in one PORT-patient (2.4%), with 47 individual events registered. We found a significantly increased odds ratio of TEE in NAC-administered PICC-patients compared to in PORT-patients (OR: 8.140, p-value: 0.042, 95% CI 1.078-61.455). Our findings indicate a greater risk for pre-RC TEEs with PICCs than with PORTs, suggesting favoring the usage of PORTs for MIBC-NAC-patients.

28619777,2017,"Peripherally InSerted CEntral catheter dressing and securement in patients with cancer: the PISCES trial. Protocol for a 2x2 factorial, superiority randomised controlled trial. ","INTRODUCTION: Around 30% of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) fail from vascular, infectious or mechanical complications. Patients with cancer are at highest risk, and this increases morbidity, mortality and costs. Effective PICC dressing and securement may prevent PICC failure; however, no large randomised controlled trial (RCT) has compared alternative approaches. We designed this RCT to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of dressing and securements to prevent PICC failure. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Pragmatic, multicentre, 2×2 factorial, superiority RCT of (1) dressings (chlorhexidine gluconate disc (CHG) vs no disc) and (2) securements (integrated securement dressing (ISD) vs securement device (SED)). A qualitative evaluation using a knowledge translation framework is included. Recruitment of 1240 patients will occur over 3 years with allocation concealment until randomisation by a centralised service. For the dressing hypothesis, we hypothesise CHG discs will reduce catheter-associated bloodstream infection (CABSI) compared with no CHG disc. For the securement hypothesis, we hypothesise that ISD will reduce composite PICC failure (infection (CABSI/local infection), occlusion, dislodgement or thrombosis), compared with SED. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: types of PICC failure; safety; costs; dressing/securement failure; dwell time; microbial colonisation; reversible PICC complications and consumer acceptability. Relative incidence rates of CABSI and PICC failure/100 devices and/1000 PICC days (with 95% CIs) will summarise treatment impact. Kaplan-Meier survival curves (and log rank Mantel-Haenszel test) will compare outcomes over time. Secondary end points will be compared between groups using parametric/non-parametric techniques; p values <0.05 will be considered to be statistically significant. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval from Queensland Health (HREC/15/QRCH/241) and Griffith University (Ref. No. 2016/063). Results will be published.

37883756,2023,A Novel Model to Prevent Venous Thromboembolism in Patients with Lung Cancer. ,"OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of nurse-patient co-management mode on preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE) in lung cancer patients with carboplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy after peripheral venipuncture central venous catheterization (PICC). METHODS: 100 patients with lung cancer admitted to the 2nd Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University from April 2020 to April 2022 were selected. All patients received a combination chemotherapy of carboplatin and gemcitabine and PICC catheterization. The patients were divided into an observation group and a control group by 1:1 simple random method, with 50 cases in each group. Patients in the control group were given routine nursing for lung cancer, and patients in the observation group were treated with nurse-patient co-management mode, and nursing intervention lasted for 2 months. General Comfort Questionnaire, self-management ability, quality of life, Self-care ability Scale, self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and self-rating depression Scale were compared before and after intervention between the two groups. The recovery of immune ability indices (CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, CD3+CD4+/CD3+CD8+) in 2 groups were detected. Complications after PICC catheterization were recorded in the two groups. RESULTS: After nursing, self-rating depression Scale and self-rating Anxiety Scale scores in both groups were significantly decreased, which were lower in the observation group than the control group (P < .001). After nursing, scores of self-concept, self-responsibility, self-care skills, and health knowledge level were significantly increased in both groups, which were higher in the observation group than control group (P < .001). After nursing, scores on the General Comfort Questionnaire, self-management scale, and quality of life were increased in both groups, which were higher in the observation group than control group (P < .0501). After nursing care, the immune competence indices of both patients increased significantly, and the immune indexes of CD3+, CD3+CD4+, and CD3+ CD4+/CD3+CD8+ in the observation group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < .05). The total incidence of complications in the observation group was significantly lower than that in the control group (8.00% vs. 26.00%, P < .001), and the incidence of venous thromboembolism was significantly lower than that in the control group (2.00% vs. 14.00%, P < .001). CONCLUSION: The nurse-patient co-management model has shown to be effective in reducing the incidence of venous thromboembolism in patients who have undergone PICC catheterization while receiving carboplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy. This model also helps patients improve their self-care and self-management abilities, alleviates adverse psychological effects, and contributes to the recovery of their immune system.

35959348,2022,Therapeutic Effect of Ultrasound-Guided Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter Combined with Predictive Nursing in Patients with Large-Area Severe Burns. ,"This study was aimed to explore the application value of ultrasound-guided peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) combined with predictive nursing in the treatment of large-area severe burns. 88 patients with large-area severe burns who visited hospital were chosen as the research objects. They were randomly divided into the observation group and the control group, with 44 cases in each. The patients in the observation group were treated with ultrasound-guided PICC combined with predictive nursing, while those in the control group were treated with traditional PICC and nursing methods. Then, the anxiety of patients was compared between groups by the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), while the depression was compared by the Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS). The pain of the patients was analyzed by the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), and a self-made nursing satisfaction questionnaire was adopted to evaluate the nursing satisfaction. The surgery-related indicators of the patients were detected and recorded (the success rate of one-time puncture, the success rate of one-time catheter placement, incidence of complications, heart rate, blood pressure, etc.). The success rates of one-time puncture (93% vs. 86%) and of catheter placement (95% vs. 81%) in the observation group were significantly higher than those in the control group, P < 0.05. The pain scores of the observation group were much lower than those of the control group at each time period, P < 0.05. The number of patients with negative emotions such as anxiety and depression in the observation group was markedly less than that in the control group. The incidence of complications in the observation group was notably lower than that in the control group (4.5% vs 18%), P < 0.05. The nursing satisfaction of the observation group was significantly higher than that of the control group (93% vs 79.5%), P < 0.05. In conclusion, ultrasound-guided PICC and predictive nursing had high clinical application values in the treatment of patients with large-area severe burns.

We conducted a systematic search for articles published between 2010 and 2021 reporting DVT incidence by catheter diameter in patients who had a PICC, followed by meta-analyses for DVT risk in each diameter group. Pooled DVT rates were incorporated into an economic model. Of 1627 abstracts screened, 47 studies were included. The primary meta-analysis of 40 studies demonstrated the incidence of DVT was 0.89%, 3.26%, 5.46%, and 10.66% for 3, 4, 5, and 6 French (Fr) PICCs (P  =  .01 between 4 and 5 Fr). Rates of DVT were not significantly different between oncology and nononcology patients (P  =  .065 for 4 Fr and P  =  .99 for 5 Fr). The DVT rate was 5.08% for ICU patients and 4.58% for non-ICU patients (P  =  .65). The economic model demonstrated an annual, incremental cost savings of US$114 053 for every 5% absolute reduction in 6 Fr PICCs use. Using the smallest PICC that meets the patients' clinical needs may help to mitigate risks and confer savings.

33053266,2021,Adolescent eating disorder with catheter-related bloodstream infection. ,"BACKGROUND: Treatment of adolescent eating disorder requires early improvement of nutritional status. Central venous hyperalimentation is used but catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) is a complication. There have been no reports examining risk factors for CRSBI in eating disorders. METHODS: The subjects were 51 patients who received nutritional therapy with the use of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) from January 2012 to December 2019. The courses of weight and white blood cell (WBC) count were examined retrospectively during nutritional therapy. Onset factors for CRBSI were determined and a case series of CRBSI caused by Candida parapsilosis is presented. RESULTS: The day of minimum weight occurred on or before day 7 in 37 of the 51 patients, and this day was preceded by the day with the lowest WBC at a significant rate. The minimum weight day was significantly delayed in CRSBI cases compared with non-CRBSI cases (P = 0.02). In the case series of CRBSI caused by C. parapsilosis, the median WBC count before CRBSI decreased to 2,570 (1,680-3,270)/μL at a median of day (12-90) 36. Catheter-related bloodstream infection developed at a median of day (26-133) 38. The PICC was immediately removed and an antifungal drug was started, leading to cure with no after effects in all subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with an eating disorder treated with nutritional therapy using a PICC, prolonged resistance to weight gain became a risk factor for developing CRBSI. White blood cell counts recover after weight gain, which suggests that there is a risk of developing CRBSI, even with improved appetite and weight gain.

35086961,2022,"Patterns, appropriateness and outcomes of peripherally inserted central catheter use in Brazil: a multicentre study of 12 725 catheters. ","BACKGROUND: Little is known about peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) use, appropriateness and device outcomes in Brazil. METHODS: We conducted an observational, prospective, cohort study spanning 16 Brazilian hospitals from October 2018 to August 2020. Patients ≥18 years receiving a PICC were included. PICC placement variables were abstracted from medical records. PICC-related major (deep vein thrombosis (DVT), central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and catheter occlusion) and minor complications were collected. Appropriateness was evaluated using the Michigan Appropriateness Guide for Intravenous Catheters (MAGIC). Devices were considered inappropriate if they were in place for <5 days, were multi-lumen, and/or were placed in patients with a creatinine >2.0 mg/dL. PICCs considered appropriate met none of these criteria. Mixed-effects logistic regression models adjusting for patient-level and hospital-level characteristics assessed the association between appropriateness and major complications. RESULTS: Data from 12 725 PICCs were included. Mean patient age was 66.4±19 years and 51.0% were female. The most common indications for PICCs were intravenous antibiotics (81.1%) and difficult access (62.7%). Most PICCs (72.2%) were placed under ultrasound guidance. The prevalence of complications was low: CLABSI (0.9%); catheter-related DVT (1.0%) and reversible occlusion (2.5%). Of the 12 725 devices included, a total of 7935 (62.3%) PICCs were inappropriate according to MAGIC. With respect to individual metrics for appropriateness, 17.0% were placed for <5 days, 60.8% were multi-lumen and 11.3% were in patients with creatinine >2.0 mg/dL. After adjusting for patient and hospital-level characteristics, multi-lumen PICCs considered inappropriate were associated with greater odds of major complications (OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.61 to 4.02). CONCLUSIONS: Use of PICCs in Brazilian hospitals appears to be safe and comparable with North America. However, opportunities to improve appropriateness remain.

33908337,2022,"Do antimicrobial and antithrombogenic peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) materials prevent catheter complications? An analysis of 42,562 hospitalized medical patients. ","OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness of antimicrobial and antithrombogenic materials incorporated into peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) to prevent bloodstream infection, thrombosis, and catheter occlusion. METHODS: Prospective cohort study involving 52 hospitals participating in the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium. Sample included adult hospitalized medical patients who received a PICC between January 2013 and October 2019. Coated and impregnated catheters were identified by name, brand, and device marketing or regulatory materials. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models with robust sandwich standard error estimates accounting for the clustered nature of data were used to identify factors associated with PICC complications in coated versus noncoated devices across general care, intensive care unit (ICU), and oncology patients. Results were expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Of 42,562 patients with a PICC, 39,806 (93.5%) were plain polyurethane, 2,263 (5.3%) incorporated antimicrobial materials, and 921 (2.2%) incorporated antithrombogenic materials. Most were inserted in general ward settings (n = 28,111, 66.0%), with 12, 078 (28.4%) and 1,407 (3.3%) placed in ICU and oncological settings, respectively. Within the entire cohort, 540 (1.3%) developed thrombosis, 745 (1.8%) developed bloodstream infection, and 4,090 (9.6%) developed catheter occlusion. Adjusting for known risk factors, antimicrobial PICCs were not associated with infection reduction (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.82-1.64), and antithrombogenic PICCs were not associated with reduction in thrombosis and occlusion (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.92-1.44). Results were consistent across populations and care settings. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial and antithrombogenic PICCs were not associated with a reduction in major catheter complications.

OBJECTIVE: While the literature suggests the use of SESDs has had successful results for device securement, it is unknown to what extent they may impact CLABSI rates. Securement and stabilization performance among devices may be a direct risk factor for CLABSIs. METHODS: A retrospective quality review of 7,776 cases was conducted at a large academic medical center. The primary researcher implemented a quantitative design which was analyzed with demographics statistics and relative risk ratio. RESULTS: There was a 288% (n = 47) increase in relative risk of CLABSI found in the AESD group compared to the SESD group. The results imply the use of SESDs may improve nursing practice and patient outcomes lowering CLABSI rates in patients with PICCs by a reduction of risks associated with securement design differences.

33827827,2021,From hospitalisation to primary care: integrative model of clinical pharmacy with patients implanted with a PICC line-research protocol for a prospective before-after study. ,"INTRODUCTION: Clinical pharmacy improves patient safety and secures drug management using information, education and good clinical practices. However, medical device management is still unexplored, and proof of effectiveness is needed. A PICC line (peripherally inserted central catheter) is a medical device for infusion. It accesses the central venous system after being implanted in a peripheral vein. However, complications after implantation often interfere with smooth execution of the treatment. We hypothesise that clinical pharmacy for medical devices could be as effective as clinical pharmacy for medications. The main objective is to assess the effectiveness of clinical pharmacy activities on the complication rate after PICC line implantation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a before-after prospective study. The study will begin with an observational period without clinical pharmacy activities, followed by an interventional period where pharmacists will intervene on drug and medical device management and provide personalised follow-up and advice. Sixty-nine adult patients will be recruited in each 6-month period from all traditional care units. The main inclusion criteria will be the implantation of a PICC line. The primary outcome is the decrease in the number of complications per patient and per month. Secondary outcomes are the consultation and hospital readmission rates, the acceptance rate of pharmaceutical interventions, the patients' quality of life, the direct hospital induced or avoided costs and the participants' satisfaction. Data will be collected using case report forms during hospitalisation and telephone follow-up after discharge. The analysis will compare these criteria during the two periods. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received the approval of our Ethics Committee (Clermont-Ferrand Southeast VI, France, number AU1586). Results will be made available to the patients or their caregivers, the sponsor and other researchers when asked, as described in the consent form. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04359056.

33195824,2020,A case series of rapidly growing mycobacterial catheter-related bloodstream infections among immunocompetent patients. ,"Rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) are ubiquitous in the environment and can cause a variety of human infections. Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) caused by RGM have been reported predominantly among immunocompromised patients. Removal of central lines and antimicrobial therapy with at least 2 active agents are generally recommended for immunocompromised patients. RGM bloodstream infections (BSIs) are rare in immunocompetent patients and clinical data are very limited. Retrospective medical record review was conducted on patients with blood cultures positive for RGM from July 2012 through March 2015 at Lemuel Shattuck Hospital, a public teaching hospital in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, United States. RGM was suspected by presence of beaded Gram-positive bacilli on Gram staining of positive conventional blood cultures and it was confirmed as RGM by Massachusetts State Public Health Laboratory. Nineteen episodes of RGM BSI were identified in 17 patients who had no known immunocompromised conditions that predispose them to opportunistic pathogens. They were predominantly young male with history of intravenous drug use. Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) was present in all episodes of RGM BSI and 74% of them clinically improved with PICC removal alone without specific antibiotic therapy for RGM. They were followed up for median duration of 45 days (interquartile range 25-385). The patients remained alive and asymptomatic until the end of follow-up periods. In immunocompetent patients, removal of catheters alone without adding specific antibiotics may be sufficient for RGM CRBSI.

37572590,2023,The clinical topography of peripherally inserted central catheter-related thrombosis in cancer patients: A prospective and longitudinal observational study based on ultrasound scans every two days. ,"AIMS: To delineate the clinical topography of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)-related thrombosis in cancer patients. BACKGROUND: Most of the clinical features of PICC-related thrombosis are based on a single follow-up, which is insufficient to reflect the full topography of a thrombosis. DESIGN: This is an observational study conducted at West China Hospital, according to the STROBE guidelines. METHODS: Cancer patients scheduled for PICC placement were potentially eligible; patients with contraindications to PICC placement or existing diseases affecting blood flow were excluded; and those who later withdrew or did not reply to our contact request during the follow-up period were eliminated from this study. Ultrasound was used to detect thrombosis from the insertion site, proximal insertion site, axillary vein to the subclavian vein once every two days for two weeks post insertion. The thrombosis and its involved venous segments, onset time and symptoms and signs were recorded. RESULTS: Among the 173 included patients, 126 (72.8 %) were identified as having thrombosis. Specifically, 113 and 126 patients were identified as having thrombosis within the first three days and the first week post insertion, respectively. In the 126 patients, thrombosis occurred at the insertion site (72.8 %) concurrently with thrombosis at the proximal insertion site (n = 120, 69.4 %), thrombosis in the axillary vein (n = 94, 54.3 %), and/or thrombosis in the subclavian vein (n = 41, 23.7 %). The log-rank test demonstrated that thrombosis in these four venous segments decreased significantly from the distal to the proximal central vein (log-rank test = 117.128, P < .001). Of 31 patients (17.9 %) who presented symptomatic thrombosis, only five patients experienced obvious swelling in the upper arm, and the other 26 patients exhibited atypical symptoms, such as soreness, tightness, numbness, tingling, or other discomforts in the palm, arm, armpit, and/or shoulder. In some thrombotic cases, ultrasonic assessment of PICC-related thrombosis did not parallel clinical symptoms and signs. CONCLUSION: PICC-related thrombosis is common and can occur very early post insertion in cancer patients, and most thromboses present atypical symptoms. More than half of the cases with thrombosis evaluated involve multiple venous segments, and the farther the venous segments are from the central vein, the higher the incidence of thrombosis tend to be and the earlier the onset time are. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The results highlight the importance that medical staff pay particular attention to patients with catheters in the first week post insertion and be alert to thrombosis presenting atypical symptoms while keeping in mind that clinical symptoms and signs are not reliable for diagnosing thrombosis.

29300286,2018,"Medical Adhesive-Related Skin Injury Prevalence at the Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter Insertion Site: A Cross-sectional, Multiple-Center Study. ","PURPOSE: We examined prevalence and associated risk factors of medical adhesive-related skin injury (MARSI) at the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) insertion site in hospitalized oncology patients in Guangxi, China. DESIGN: A cross-sectional, multiple-center epidemiological study. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: The sample comprised 697 adult inpatients at 4 tertiary hospitals (3 general hospitals and 1 oncology hospital). The facilities are located in the western China. METHODS: Trained nurses examined and assessed all subjects' skin exposed to medical adhesive during PICC maintenance process followed by recording the morphological features of the skin lesions, complaints of the patients, and information of catheter maintenance. Data related to patient demographics, PICC insertion information, disease, and laboratory parameters were collected through the electronic medical record. The prevalence of MARSI was calculated statistically and risk factors were examined using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: A total of 697 patients (mean age, 48.86 years; range, 18-89 years) were enrolled. The prevalence of MARSI was 19.7% (137/697), including mechanical skin injury 5.0% (35/697), contact dermatitis 14.8% (103/697), folliculitis 1.0% (7/697), and moisture-associated skin damage 1.3% (9/697). There were significant differences in presence of MARSI and age, diagnoses, body mass index, smoking history, indwelling time of PICC, types of dressing, types of antiseptic, a history of MARSI, and skin allergies (P < .05). Multivariate analysis identified 50 years or older (odds ratio [OR], 2.202; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.222-3.968; P = .009), a history of MARSI (OR, 14.834; 95% CI, 6.534-33.680; P = .000) as independent risk factors for MARSI. Additionally, type of transparent film dressing used was a risk factor for MARSI (OR, 3.292; 95% CI, 1.092-9.923; P = .034). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of MARSI is significant in hospitalized oncology patients in China. Our study provided new knowledge for the epidemiology of MARSI and identified high-risk population, which will guide clinical nursing practice and ensure patient safety.

33840246,2021,Subcutaneous tunneling technique to improve outcomes for patients undergoing chemotherapy with peripherally inserted central catheters: a randomized controlled trial. ,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the value of the subcutaneous tunneling technique versus the normal technique in improving the outcomes of patients undergoing chemotherapy with peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs). METHODS: One hundred thirty patients were randomly divided into an experimental group (subcutaneous tunneling technique) and control group (normal technique) according to the PICC placement technique, and clinical data were compared between the groups. RESULTS: In total, 129 PICCs were successfully inserted. Compared with the control group, the experimental group had a lower occurrence of complications after placement (especially catheter dislodgement: 3.1% vs. 15.4%, venous thrombosis: 3.1% vs. 15.4%, and wound oozing: 14.1% vs. 27.7%), lower occurrence of unscheduled PICC removal (3.1% vs. 13.8%), greater comfort during placement (14.16 ± 2.21 vs. 15.09 ± 2.49 on a scale ranging from 6 to 30 points, with higher scores indicating lower degrees of comfort), and lower costs of PICC maintenance (median (interquartile range) per-day maintenance cost: 13.90 (10.99-32.83) vs. 15.69 (10.51-57.46) Yuan). The occurrence of complications and amount of bleeding during placement were not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The subcutaneous tunneling technique can improve PICC placement by reducing complications and costs of maintenance with better patient comfort during placement.

25198809,2015,A comparison of infections and complications in central venous catheters in adults with solid tumours. ,"AIM: The aim of this study is to compare the complication rates of three vascular access devices in patients with solid tumours having infusion chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational study of 58 central venous catheter (CVC) lines inserted in 55 patients with solid tumours requiring infusional chemotherapy was performed. The study was conducted between January 2011 and August 2013, looking at complication and infection rates as primary outcomes. Data were recorded from patients with 19 tunnelled cuffed silicone catheters, nine with peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) and 30 central venous ports. RESULTS: The two CVC groups (ports and non-ports) matched equally in terms of tumour site; all patients with solid tumours were included, haematology patients were excluded and chemotherapy regimens were comparable. Thirteen out of 28 non- ports had complications compared with one out of 30 central venous ports. Ten out of 19 tunnelled catheters had complications including three displacements and seven were removed due to infection. There were no reports of line-related sepsis in the PICC or ports. Three out of nine PICC lines had complications including two displacements and one PICC blocked permanently requiring removal. In addition, one port out of 30 was removed due to erosion through the skin. There were no episodes of thrombosis or fibrin sheath formation related to any of the devices. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we demonstrated that central venous ports and PICC lines in patients undergoing infusional chemotherapy had lower line infection rates than tunnelled catheters, and only ports have been shown to be almost complication-free. In addition, we found infection rates higher in CVCs s cared for by patient/carers rather than hospital only care, and higher in colorectal patients with stomas. Therefore, we recommend that central venous ports are a safe, acceptable CVC option for infusional chemotherapy for adults with solid tumours.

25953205,2015,Evaluation of PICC complications in orthopedic inpatients with bone infection for long-term intravenous antibiotics therapy. ,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the complications of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in orthopedic patients with chronic bone orthopedic infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this retrospective study and informed consent was waived. Records of 180 consecutives PICCs placed in patients hospitalized in the orthopedic surgery department were reviewed. All patients had bones infections necessitating a long-term intravenous antibiotics therapy. All PICC complications were recorded during the patient hospitalization: infection [catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), central line associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), exit-site infection, septic phlebitis], thrombosis, occlusion, mechanical complication (accidental withdrawal, malposition, median nerve irritation). RESULTS: One hundred and eighty PICCs were placed in 136 patients. Mean duration of catheterization was 21 days (total 3911 PICC-days). Thirty-six PICCs (20%) were removed due to complications (9.2 complications per 1000 PICC-days): 14 (8%) infections (one CRBSI (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), one septic phlebitis (P. aeruginosa), two exit-site infections and 10 CLABSIs), 11 (6%) occlusions, and 12 (7%) mechanical complications (10 accidental withdrawals, one malposition, one median nerve irritation). One patient had two complications simultaneously. After multivariate analysis, two risk factors were significantly associated with the overall occurrence of complications: age more than 70 years [OR = 2.89 (1.06-7.89], p = 0.04] and number of lumen at least two [OR = 2.64 (1.03-6.75), p = 0.04]. CONCLUSIONS: Even in orthopedic patients with chronic orthopedic bone infection, PICCs have a low rate of complication. The increasing lumen number of the PICC is a potential risk factor in our series. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Administration, Intravenous' 'Adult' 'Age Factors' 'Aged'

34973357,2022,Complications of peripherally inserted central catheters in adult hospitalized patients and outpatients in the KTFIXPICC study: A randomized controlled trial evaluating a fixation device KT FIX Plussystem. ,"BACKGROUND: Poor securement potentiates Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) complications. A dressing device (KT FIX Plus) offers stronger skin attachment, which may reduce the risk of dressing disruption. We aimed to evaluate this device. METHODS: We conducted a single-center parallel-group open-label randomized controlled trial. Hospitalized and outpatient consecutive adults requiring PICCs were randomized to KT FIX Plus or standard of care (SOC). The primary endpoint was the composite of PICC-associated complications until removal, including occlusion, migration, accidental withdrawal, infection, thrombosis, and hematoma. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was observed in terms of complications: 67 (35%) in the KT FIX Plus group vs 36 (37%) in the SOC group (log-rank P = 0.76). In multivariate Cox analysis, independent risk factors for PICC-associated complications were obesity (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 1.08, P < .001) and diabetes (aHR, 1.85, P = .039), adjusting for chronic renal failure, number of lumens, catheter/vein diameter ratio and duration of home-based care. Multiple lumen catheters increased the risk of accidental withdrawal and migration (HR, 2.4, P = .008). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the use of KT FIX Plus did not reduce the risk of complications adjusting for other risk factors such as obesity and diabetes. The number of catheter lumens is one of the modifiable factors to reduce complications. Further studies are required to find the best securement and dressing system.

33652363,2021,To PICC or not to PICC? A cross-sectional survey of vascular access practices in the ICU. ,"PURPOSE: Vascular access patterns in the intensive care unit (ICU) have shifted from non-tunneled central venous catheters (CVCs) towards peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs). We evaluated perceptions of critical care practitioners regarding these devices and variation in evidence-based practice. MATERIALS: A 35-question survey on ICU vascular access was deployed in 13 Michigan hospitals. Descriptive statistics summarized responses. Differences in utilization, perceptions and evidence-based practices between PICCs and CVCs, by participant and site-level characteristics, were assessed. RESULTS: 314 of 621 eligible providers responded to the survey (response rate 51%). 15% of providers reported not routinely using ultrasound when placing CVCs. Respondents whom were trainees, from larger hospitals, and from closed ICUs were more likely to use ultrasound (p < 0.001). Additionally, 21% of respondents stated they did not specify number of CVC lumens, while 46% did not specify number of PICC lumens (p < 0.001). The likelihood of specifying PICC lumens increased when vascular access protocols were in place (p = 0.001). 2/3 of respondents (n = 173, 66%) stated more research on ICU vascular access was needed. CONCLUSION: Variation in guideline-based vascular access practices exists in the ICU. Defined local protocols may improve guideline adherence. Studies evaluating vascular access decisions and patient safety in the ICU appear necessary.

34297997,2021,Central venous access devices for the delivery of systemic anticancer therapy (CAVA): a randomised controlled trial. ,"BACKGROUND: Hickman-type tunnelled catheters (Hickman), peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), and totally implanted ports (PORTs) are used to deliver systemic anticancer treatment (SACT) via a central vein. We aimed to compare complication rates and costs of the three devices to establish acceptability, clinical effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of the devices for patients receiving SACT. METHODS: We did an open-label, multicentre, randomised controlled trial (Cancer and Venous Access [CAVA]) of three central venous access devices: PICCs versus Hickman (non-inferiority; 10% margin); PORTs versus Hickman (superiority; 15% margin); and PORTs versus PICCs (superiority; 15% margin). Adults (aged ≥18 years) receiving SACT (≥12 weeks) for solid or haematological malignancy from 18 oncology units in the UK were included. Four randomisation options were available: Hickman versus PICCs versus PORTs (2:2:1), PICCs versus Hickman (1:1), PORTs versus Hickman (1:1), and PORTs versus PICCs (1:1). Randomisation was done using a minimisation algorithm stratifying by centre, body-mass index, type of cancer, device history, and treatment mode. The primary outcome was complication rate (composite of infection, venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, inability to aspirate blood, mechanical failure, and other) assessed until device removal, withdrawal from study, or 1-year follow-up. This study is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN44504648. FINDINGS: Between Nov 8, 2013, and Feb 28, 2018, of 2714 individuals screened for eligibility, 1061 were enrolled and randomly assigned, contributing to the relevant comparison or comparisons (PICC vs Hickman n=424, 212 [50%] on PICC and 212 [50%] on Hickman; PORT vs Hickman n=556, 253 [46%] on PORT and 303 [54%] on Hickman; and PORT vs PICC n=346, 147 [42%] on PORT and 199 [58%] on PICC). Similar complication rates were observed for PICCs (110 [52%] of 212) and Hickman (103 [49%] of 212). Although the observed difference was less than 10%, non-inferiority of PICCs was not confirmed (odds ratio [OR] 1·15 [95% CI 0·78-1·71]) potentially due to inadequate power. PORTs were superior to Hickman with a complication rate of 29% (73 of 253) versus 43% (131 of 303; OR 0·54 [95% CI 0·37-0·77]). PORTs were superior to PICCs with a complication rate of 32% (47 of 147) versus 47% (93 of 199; OR 0·52 [0·33-0·83]). INTERPRETATION: For most patients receiving SACT, PORTs are more effective and safer than both Hickman and PICCs. Our findings suggest that most patients receiving SACT for solid tumours should receive a PORT within the UK National Health Service.

32883154,2021,Reduction of bacterial colonization at the exit site of peripherally inserted central catheters: A comparison between chlorhexidine-releasing sponge dressings and cyano-acrylate. ,"INTRODUCTION: A serious complication associated with Central Venous Access Device (CVAD) is infection because of bacterial contamination, either by the extra-luminal or by the intra-luminal route.We evaluated the efficacy, the safety, and the cost-effectiveness of two strategies for non-inferiority in controlling bacterial colonization of the exit-site of Peripherally-Inserted Central Catheters (PICC). METHODS: After PICC placement, a skin swab of the exit site was taken and cultured. In group A the exit site was sealed with N-butyl-cyanoacrylate glue, while in group B a chlorhexidine-releasing sponge dressing was applied. A second skin culture was taken at day 7. RESULTS: A total of 51 patients were enrolled in each group. In 42 patients the second skin culture was not performed because of 20 patients were lost at follow-up or deceased and in 22 patients the dressing needed to be changed early, because of local bleeding (13 cases, in group B) or because of dressing detachment (four in group A and five in group B). The microbiological study was completed in 36 patients in group A and 24 in group B. No microorganisms were isolated in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: Both strategies were effective in controlling bacterial colonization. Glue was effective in reducing local bleeding, and it was more cost-effective than sponge dressing. During the first week, when local bleeding and bacterial colonization must be prevented, glue might be more appropriate than chlorhexidine-releasing dressing; after the first week chlorhexidine-releasing dressing might be preferable, considering that the safety of glue application on the skin for prolonged periods is still questionable.

37550791,2023,Comparison of microbial colonization rates between central venous catheters and peripherally inserted central catheters. ,"BACKGROUND: Central venous catheters (CVCs) and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), have been widely used as intravascular devices in critically ill patients. However, they might evoke complications, such as catheter colonization that has been considered as predisposing factor for central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs). Although numerous studies have compared the risk of bloodstream infections between PICCs and CVCs, comparative studies on their colonization rates are limited. OBJECTIVES: The episodes of catheter colonization in critically ill patients with CVCs or PICCs were retrospectively analysed during a two-year period in a Greek tertiary care hospital and colonization rates, microbial profiles and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were compared. METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data of consecutive hospitalized critically-ill patients who underwent PICC and CVC placement between May 2017-May 2019 were analysed. All catheters were examined by the semiquantitative culture technique for bacterial pathogens, either as a routine process after catheter removal or after suspicion of infection. Species identification and antimicrobial resistance patterns were determined by the Vitek2 automated system. RESULTS: During the survey period a total of 122/1187 (10.28%) catheter colonization cases were identified among CVCs and 19/639 (2.97%) cases among PICCs (p = 0.001). The colonization rate was 12.48/1000 catheter-days for the CVC group and 1.71/1000 catheter-days for the PICC group (p < 0.001). The colonization rate per 1000 catheter-days due to multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) was 3.85 in all study cases, 7.26 (71/122) in the CVC group and 0.63 (7/19) in the PICC group (p < 0.001). Within the CVC group, the most common microorganism isolated was MDR Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 38, 31.1%) followed by MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 20, 16.4%). In the PICC group, the predominant microorganism isolated was Candida spp. (n = 5, 23.8%) followed by MDR K. pneumoniae and MDR A. baumannii in equal numbers (n = 3, 14.2%). CONCLUSION: PICC lines were associated with significantly lower colonization rates comparing to the CVC ones. In addition, patterns of microbial colonization revealed a trend over the predominance of MDR gram-negatives in CVCs suggesting that PICCs might be a safer alternative for prolonged inpatient intravascular access. Prevention programs directed by local microbial ecology may diminish catheter colonization rates and CLABSIs. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Humans' '*Central Venous Catheters/adverse effects'

36960818,2023,Nudging to select single-lumen over multiple-lumen peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in a large safety net system. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are increasingly used for vascular access in inpatient settings. Compared to multilumen PICCs, single-lumen PICCs carry a lower rate of complications, including central-line-associated bloodstream infection and thrombosis. Despite this, multilumen PICCs are still overused. METHODS: This quality improvement initiative was implemented across 11 hospitals at New York City Health + Hospitals safety net system. The electronic health record (EHR) interventional radiology or vascular access team consultation orders were modified to allow for lumen choice, with default selection to a single-lumen PICC. RESULTS: Average single-lumen PICC utilization increased by 25.5%, from 44.4% to 69.9% (P < .001). CLABSI rates had a nonsignificant reduction by 26.7% from 2.44 to 1.79 infections per month (P = .255). Among provider types in the postintervention period, single-lumen PICC utilization ranged from 67.7% for advanced practice providers to 82.4%-94.6% for physicians. Among provider specialties, utilization ranged from 31.8% for neurology to 97.7% for orthopedics. Additionally, there was large variation in pre- and postintervention differences in utilization by hospital. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully increased single-lumen PICC utilization across all 11 safety net hospitals. This expands on previous work on improving single-lumen PICC use and use of default nudges in large, resource-limited settings. Further study is needed to examine variation among provider types, specialties, and hospitals. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Humans' '*Catheterization, Central Venous/adverse effects'

34711086,2023,Identifying the impact of the Zone Insertion Method(TM) (ZIM(TM)): A randomized controlled trial. ,"BACKGROUND: In 2011, Dawson proposed the Zone Insertion Method(TM) (ZIM(TM)) to identify the optimal peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) insertion site in the upper arm. However, data on the effectiveness and safety of the ZIM(TM) in guiding PICC placement in Chinese population is limited. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 120 cancer patients were randomly assigned to the upper portion of the red zone (RZ), the green zone (GZ) and the lower portion of the yellow zone (YZ) groups (at a 1:1:1 ratio). The aim was to compare the degree of patient comfort and the incidence of major PICC complications among the three insertion zones based on the ZIM(TM) in a Chinese Cancer Center. (Clinical Trials. Gov number, ChiCTR1900024111). RESULTS: A total of 118 catheters were inserted in 118 patients (2 patients were lost to follow-up). After the 1-month follow-up, patients randomly assigned to the YZ group had a higher degree of comfort with a lower score than those assigned to the other two zone groups: 30.21±3.16 in the YZ group versus 31.65±2.51 in the RZ group and 31.59±2.92 in the GZ group (P=.046). The incidence of thrombosis (10/40, 25%) and occlusion (4/40, 10%) in the RZ, which were significantly higher than those in the other two zone groups (χ(2) =7.368, P=.02; χ(2) =5.778, P =.03), whereas the risk in the GZ group was similar to that in the YZ group. The incidence of contact dermatitis in the GZ group was significantly higher than that of the other two zone groups (χ(2)=12.873, P=.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the lower portion of YZ seems to be another suitable PICC insertion site for a higher degree of comfort and a lower risk of occlusion and thrombosis, which broadens the choice of PICC insertion sites in the upper arm for clinical practice.

26519981,2016,Complication rates among peripherally inserted central venous catheters and centrally inserted central catheters in the medical intensive care unit. ,"PURPOSE: There are limited contemporary data describing the rates of catheter-related deep vein thrombosis (CRDVT) and central line-associated bloodstream infection for peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) and centrally inserted central venous catheters (CICCs) in the medical intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 200 PICCs (dual/triple lumen) and 200 CICCs (triple/quadruple lumen) placed in medical ICU adults at Mayo Rochester between 2012 and 2013. Central lines were followed from insertion time until hospital dismissal (primary analysis) or ICU discharge (secondary analysis). Symptomatic CRDVT was determined by Doppler ultrasound. Central line-associated bloodstream infection was defined according to federal reporting criteria. RESULTS: During 1730 PICC days and 637 CICC days, the incidence of CRDVT when followed until hospital dismissal was 4% and 1% (4.6 and 3.1 per 1000 catheter-days), respectively, P = .055. When censored at the time of ICU dismissal, the rates were 2% and 1% (5.3 and 3.7 per 1000 catheter-days), P = .685. Only 1 central line-associated bloodstream infection occurred in a PICC following ICU dismissal, P > .999. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombotic and infectious complications were uncommon following PICC and CICC insertion, with no significant difference in complication rates observed. Half of PICC DVTs occurred on the general floor, and like all central catheters placed in the ICU, PICCs should be aggressively discontinued when no longer absolutely needed.

We investigated the efficacy of bedside thrombolysis with urokinase for the management of catheter thrombosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data from patients who had undergone CVC insertion by a single surgeon in a single center between April 2012 and June 2014. We used a protocol for the management of CVCs and when catheter thrombosis was confirmed, 5,000 U urokinase was infused into the catheter. RESULTS: A total of 137 CVCs were inserted in 126 patients. The most common catheter-related complication was thrombosis (12, 8.8%) followed by infection (8, 5.8%). Nine of the 12 patients (75%) with catheter thrombosis were recanalized successfully with urokinase. The rate of CVC recanalization was higher in the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) group (87.5%) than the chemoport group (50%). Reintervention for catheter-related thrombosis was needed in only 2.2% of patients when thrombolytic therapy using urokinase was applied. Age <60 years (P=0.035), PICC group (P=0.037) and location of the catheter tip above the superior vena cava (P=0.044) were confirmed as independent risk factors for catheter thrombosis. CONCLUSION: Thrombolysis therapy using urokinase could successfully manage CVC thrombosis. Reintervention was rarely needed when a protocol using urokinase was applied for the management of CVC thromboses. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],[],"['Central venous catheters' 'Thrombosis'

36644041,2022,Incidence and Risk Factors for Superficial and Deep Vein Thrombosis in Post-Craniotomy/Craniectomy Neurosurgical Patients. ,"Background Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is quite common among post-operative neurosurgical patients. This study aims to identify the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) among post-craniotomy/craniectomy patients and further evaluate established hypercoagulability risk factors such as trauma, tumors, and surgery. Methodology This single-center retrospective study investigated 197 patients who underwent a craniotomy/craniectomy. The incidences of DVT and SVT were compared, along with laterality and peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line involvement. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify risk factors for post-craniotomy/craniectomy VTE. This model included variables such as age, post-operative days before anticoagulant administration, female sex, indications for surgery such as tumor and trauma, presence of a PICC line, and anticoagulant administration. Results Among the 197 post-craniotomy/craniectomy patients (39.6% female; mean age 53.8±15.7 years), the incidences of DVT, SVT, and VTE were 4.6%, 9.6%, and 12.2%, respectively. The multivariate logistic regression analysis found that increasing the number of days between surgery and administration of anticoagulants significantly increased the risk of VTE incidence (odds ratio 1.183, 95% CI 1.068-1.311, p = 0.001). Conclusions Contrary to existing evidence, this study did not find trauma or the presence of tumors to be risk factors for VTE. Future prospective studies should assess VTE risk assessment models such as ""3 Bucket"" or ""Caprini"" to develop universal guidelines for administering anticoagulant therapy to post-craniotomy/craniectomy patients that consider the timing of post-operative therapy initiation.

35382174,2022,Prevalence of Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSI) in Intensive Care and Medical-Surgical Units. ,"BACKGROUND:  Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) remain an important preventable healthcare-associated infection with a 2020 rate of 0.87 (per 1,000 central line days) in the United States intensive care units (ICU). METHODS:  This was a retrospective cohort study of all adult patients in our institution. The total number of central venous catheter (CVC) insertions and line days were determined using daily unit logs maintained by unit managers. Central line insertion practice (CLIP) compliance was calculated as the total number of CLIP forms submitted divided by the total number of newly-inserted CVCs with and without associated CLIP forms as determined by unit logs. RESULTS: A total of 1,125 CVCs were reviewed (448 - ICU and 677 - medical-surgical units). Of the 13 CLABSI, one patient had internal jugular (IJ), one patient had subclavian (SC), four patients had femoral, three patients had peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) and four patients had hemodialysis catheters. Patients with CLABSI had CVC inserted for a range of five to 92 days with the average number of line days being 29 days. CONCLUSION:  Based on the analysis of our CLABSI patient population, we recommend our institution implement the following criteria to decrease the prevalence of CLABSI: All patients receiving a CVC must adhere to CLIP documentation in all units, any femoral or HD CVC placed without a CLIP form should have the line changed within 48 hours, those patients with a femoral CVC or hemodialysis catheter in place for four days or greater with an abnormal WBC (<4.0 or >11 mg/dL) or abnormal temperature (<97.0F or >100.4F) should be considered for catheter exchange, and those patients with an IJ, SC, or PICC CVC in place for seven days or greater with an abnormal WBC or abnormal temperature should have the catheter changed.

35495896,2022,Application of Nursing Intervention Based on Intelligent Grip Strength System in Patients with Tumor PICC: A Case-Control Study on Promoting Functional Exercise and Quality of Life. ,"OBJECTIVE: A case-control study was conducted to elucidate the impact of application of nursing intervention based on intelligent grip strength system in patients with tumor peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) on promoting functional exercise and life quality. METHODS: A total of 100 patients with tumor PICC treated in our hospital from April 2019 to April 2021 were enrolled. The patients were randomly assigned into control group and study group. The control group received routine nursing, and the study group received nursing intervention based on intelligent grip strength system. RESULTS: First of all, we compared the nursing satisfaction between the two groups: the study group was very satisfied in 43 cases, satisfactory in 6 cases, and general in 1 case, and the satisfaction rate was 100.00%, while in the control group, 29 cases were very satisfied, 10 cases were satisfied, 6 cases were general, and 5 cases were dissatisfied. The satisfaction rate was 90.00%. As such, the nursing satisfaction of the study group was higher compared to the control (P < 0.05). Secondly, we compared the average blood flow velocity per unit time of axillary vein at different moments. Before catheterization, there exited no significant difference (P > 0.05). The average blood flow velocity per unit time of axillary vein in the study group was faster compared to the control at different time points (P < 0.05). In terms of the average blood flow velocity per unit time of axillary vein at different time points between the two groups, there exited no significant difference before catheterization (P > 0.05). But 14 and 28 days after catheterization, the average blood flow velocity per unit time of axillary vein in the study group was better when compared to the control (P < 0.05). Comparing the incidence of catheter-related complications, the incidence of catheter-related complications such as redness and swelling, phlebitis, catheter occlusion, and catheter slip in the study group (12.00%) was lower compared to the control (60.00%) (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in vascular diameter, peak blood flow velocity, and vascular pressure between the two groups before nursing (P > 0.05), but after nursing, the vascular diameter and peak blood flow velocity group were higher, and the vascular pressure was lower in the study (P < 0.05). Comparing the scores of functional exercise compliance, the scores of grip exercise compliance, exercise monitoring compliance, active help seeking compliance, exercise attention compliance, and the total score of compliance in the study group were higher compared to the control (P < 0.05). Finally, we compared the scores of life quality. Before nursing, there exhibited no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). The scores of physiological function, psychological function, social function, and health self-cognition in the study group were lower when compared to control (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The utilization of intelligent grip strength system can improve the functional exercise compliance of PICC patients, effectively facilitate the venous blood circulation of upper limbs, and strengthen the life quality, as well as reduce the incidence of catheter-related thrombosis. However, more multicenter, large sample, randomized controlled studies should be carried out to explore the impact of intelligent grip strength system on the long-term effect of functional exercise in patients with PICC.

33594508,2021,Assessing the thrombosis risk of peripherally inserted central catheters in cancer patients using Caprini risk assessment model: a prospective cohort study. ,"PURPOSE: There was no optimal risk assessment tool to stratify the risk of peripherally inserted central catheter-related venous thromboembolism (PICC-RVT) in cancer patients. We currently use the Caprini risk assessment model for thrombotic risk assessment, but no evidence exists on the effectiveness of Caprini in such patients. This study was to assess the validity of the Caprini in Chinese cancer patients with PICCs. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 468 participants. Following calculating the Caprini score, color Doppler ultrasonography was performed every 7 days for 3 weeks to confirm PICC-RVT. RESULTS: There was a correlation between PICC-RVT and the Caprini score. Compared with scores of 5, the risk was 2.089-fold greater (95% CI 1.165-3.743, P = 0.012) in patients with a score of 6 and 7, and 7.156-fold greater (95% CI 3.157-16.217, P < 0.001) in patients with scores ≥8. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.636 (95% CI 0.590-0.680; P < 0.001). 6 was the best cutoff point for Caprini, with a sensitivity of 0.76 and a specificity of 0.44. CONCLUSIONS: The Caprini can be used for high-risk screening of the PICC-RVT in cancer patients, and classification of the highest risk level using a score of 6 can be more clinically significant compared to 5 as recommended. The results provide evidence for the practitioner's early use of the Caprini to assess the thrombotic risk in patients with PICCs and take timely prevention measures. But pharmacological prevention should be considered seriously for its low specificity. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['*Catheterization, Central Venous/adverse effects'

36037624,2022,Long-term results of the treatment of adolescents and adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia with a pediatric-inspired regimen delivered on an outpatient basis: A single institution experience. ,"The results of treatment of adolescents and adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remain unsatisfactory. Pediatric-inspired treatments seem to be related with better outcomes. 126 adolescent and adult patients with ALL were treated in a 37-year period with a pediatric inspired combined chemotherapy (PICC) schedule, delivered on an outpatient basis and based on the St. Jude´s TOTAL XI pediatric protocol employing vincristine, prednisone, asparaginase, daunorubicin, etoposide, cytarabine, methotrexate, mercaptopurine and triple intrathecal therapy. 80 % of patients were able to receive the initial seven-week period of induction / consolidation fully as outpatients and 77 % achieved a complete remission. In adolescents and young adults (AYAs) the median probability of overall survival (OS) was 44 months, whereas the 5-year OS was 48 %. In adults, the median probability of OS was 24 months, and the 5-year OS was 32 %. Patients with T-cell ALL did significantly worse than those with a B cell phenotype (OS at 5 years 17 versus 40 %, respectively). These figures are better than those informed in our country employing more aggressive, in-hospital schedules such as the hyper-CVAD. We found that, in AYAs and adult patients with ALL, the use of an asparaginase-containing PICC delivered on an outpatient basis renders acceptable results, better than those obtained in similar socioeconomic circumstances employing adult-oriented schedules. Additional studies are needed to assess the usefulness of these PICC treatments in adult individuals with ALL treated in underprivileged circumstances, such as those prevailing in LMIC.

34300069,2021,Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter Placement in a Cardiology Ward: A Focus Group Study of Nurses' Perspectives. ,"Intravenous therapy administration through peripheral venous catheters is one of the most common nursing procedures performed in clinical contexts. However, peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) remain insufficiently used by nurses and can be considered a potential alternative for patients who need aggressive intravenous therapy and/or therapy for extended periods. The purpose of this study was to understand nurses' perspectives about PICC implementation in their clinical practice. As part of an action-research project, three focus groups were developed in June 2019 with nineteen nurses of a cardiology ward from a Portuguese tertiary hospital. From the content analysis, two main categories emerged: 'nursing practices' and 'patients'. Nurses considered PICC beneficial for their clinical practice because it facilitates maintenance care and catheter replacement rates. Moreover, nurses suggested that, since there is a need for specific skills, the constitution of vascular access teams, as recommended by international guidelines, could be an advantage. Regarding patient benefits, nurses highlighted a decrease in the number of venipunctures and also of patient discomfort, which was associated with the number of peripheral venous catheters. Infection prevention was also indicated. As an emerging medical device used among clinicians, peripherally inserted central catheters seem to be essential to clinical practice.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Review of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) and small-bore central catheter (SBCC) referral and placement data from VAT and IR databases was conducted over a 12-year period. SBCC referral was automatic for patients with creatinine levels ≥ 3 mg/dL or a renal transplant regardless of creatinine level unless dialysis was not planned. All SBCC insertions, regardless of referral source, were identified and reviewed, and SBCC placements prompted by K/DOQI PICC contraindication were identified. Catheter types, indications, access sites, technical success, and complications were ascertained. RESULTS: A total of 35,781 requests for PICC placement were made to the VAT; 1,889 (5%) were referred to IR for SBCC placement per institutional policy, and 2,200 SBCCs were attempted or newly placed during this period, 1,879 (85%) based on K/DOQI contraindications. Primary indication for SBCC placement was antibiotic therapy (59%). Access sites included right internal jugular vein (IJV) (70%), left IJV (24%), right external jugular vein (EJV) (3%), left EJV (2%), right common femoral vein (CFV) (0.3%), and left CFV (0.2%). Technical success rate of SBCC insertion was 99%. Six minor (0.3%) and three major (0.1%) complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Automatic referral for SBCC placement in patients with CKD via VAT and IR protocols may eliminate PICC placement and thereby protect peripheral veins needed for hemodialysis. SBCC placement has high technical success and low complication rates. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Biomarkers/blood'

28744109,2017,Comparison of three types of central venous catheters in patients with malignant tumor receiving chemotherapy. ,"BACKGROUND: Central venous catheters (CVCs) have been an effective access for chemotherapy instead of peripherally intravenous catheters. There were limited studies on the choices and effects of different types of CVCs for chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to compare the complications, cost, and patients' quality of life and satisfaction of three commonly used CVCs for chemotherapy, such as implanted venous port, peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), and external non-tunneled central venous catheters (NTCs). METHODS: A double-center prospective cohort study was carried out from March 2014 to December 2016. Catheterization situation, complications, catheter maintenance, cost, and patients' quality of life and satisfaction were recorded, investigated, and analyzed. Forty-five ports, 60 PICCs and 40 NTCs were included. All the CVCs were followed up to catheter removal. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in catheterization success rates between port and PICC. NTC had less success rate by one puncture compared with port. Ports had fewer complications compared with PICCs and NTCs. The complication rates of ports, PICCs and NTCs were 2.2%, 40%, and 27.5%, respectively. If the chemotherapy process was <12 months, NTCs cost least, and the cost of port was much higher than PICC and NTC. When the duration time was longer than 12 months, the cost of port had no difference with the cost of PICC. Quality of life and patients' satisfaction of port group were significantly higher than the other two groups. CONCLUSION: Although port catheterization costs more and needs professional medical staff and strict operational conditions, ports have fewer complications and higher quality of life and patients' satisfaction than PICCs and NTCs. Therefore, not following consideration of the economic factor, we recommend port as a safe and an effective chemotherapy access for cancer patients, especially for whom needing long chemotherapy process.

In the clinical setting, the CT images of all patients at a large academic hospital for one calendar year who underwent power injection of CT contrast media were reviewed for CT-PICC displacement. A retrospective comparison of the rate of displacement during the 8 months before implementing a protocol with a lower initial rate of saline flush and the rate of displacement for the 4 months after the protocol change was performed. RESULTS: Laboratory modeling showed dramatic movement of the CT-PICC at higher rates of saline flush. This movement was attributed to differences in viscosity between contrast media and saline. The clinical arm of the study found that 8.2% of the 243 examinations performed before implementing the new protocol resulted in displacement, in comparison with 2.2% of the 138 examinations performed afterward. This difference was considered statistically significant (p = 0.023). CONCLUSION: Initiation of saline flush at high injection rates correlates with a higher rate of CT-PICC displacement. The use of a slower initial rate of saline flush injection significantly reduces the rate of displacement.

24983259,2014,Risk factors associated with catheter-related upper extremity deep vein thrombosis in patients with peripherally inserted central venous catheters: a prospective observational cohort study: part 2. ,"This is the second part of a 2-part series that reports on the results of a prospective observational cohort study designed to examine risk factors associated with symptomatic upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT) in patients with peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs). Part 1, published in the May/June 2014 issue of the Journal of Infusion Nursing, provided an extensive review and critique of the literature regarding risk factors associated with catheter-related UEDVT and identified 28 suspected risk factors. A study was undertaken to examine each of the risk factors among 203 acute care patients with PICCs, 13 of whom experienced a UEDVT, yielding an incidence of 6.4%. The most common reason for admission was infection (33.5%), and the primary reason for insertion of the PICC was venous access (58.6%). Hypertension (P = .022) and obesity (P = .008), defined as a body mass index ≥30, were associated with UEDVT. The clinical symptoms of edema (P < .001) and a 3-cm or more increase in arm circumference (P < .001) in the PICC arm after PICC placement were associated with UEDVT. All other variables were not statistically significant. The results suggest that patients who are obese and hypertensive may be at greater risk for the development of UEDVT and that the physical finding of edema and increased arm circumference in the PICC arm are possibly suggestive of UEDVT.

27747899,2017,Safety and efficacy of outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy in an academic infectious disease clinic. ,"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Outpatient parenteral therapy (OPAT) has become a safe and effective modality for patients requiring intravenous or prolonged antimicrobial therapy since the 1970s. It is being increasingly utilized in various settings; however, studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of clinic-based OPAT are limited. Since 2012, patients being considered for OPAT have required an infectious disease (ID) consultation at our institution. Candidates receiving once-daily antimicrobials who were ineligible for home infusion or nursing home placement as determined by their insurance companies and those who preferred the clinic over nursing home or home infusion were referred to the ID clinic. This study assessed the safety and outcome of patients receiving OPAT in an academic inner-city ID clinic in Detroit, Michigan. METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of electronic medical records of patients, identified through clinic records, who received at least 2 days of OPAT from December 2012 to December 2015. Demographics, types of infections, antimicrobial regimen used, adverse events and outcome were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 122 cases were identified during the study period. Mean age was 62 years with 55% male; 102 (84%) of 122 patients had peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC). Fifty-five per cent of patients participated in the clinic-based OPAT programme for insurance reasons, and 43% preferred the clinic over nursing home or home infusion. The most common infections were bone and joint (36%), followed by skin and soft tissue (18%) and urinary tract infections (12%). Ertapenem (44%) and daptomycin (41%) alone or in combination were used most frequently with 40% of patients receiving at least 4 weeks of treatment. Thirteen patients (11%) experienced one or more adverse drug events on daptomycin and/or ertapenem; of these, nine (69%) patients were receiving daptomycin monotherapy. Gastrointestinal symptoms (29%), cramping and myalgias (29%) and asymptomatic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation (24%) were the most common adverse events. Three (3%) of 102 patients had PICC-related complications. Fourteen (88%) of 16 patients with adverse events or PICC-related complications required changing or stopping antibiotics; two (2%) had infection-related readmission. Conversely, 113 (93%) of 122 patients who completed treatment were considered cured and none had treatment failure at the end of 30 days of treatment. No patients died as a result of treatment or infection-related complications. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Outpatient parenteral therapy in our academic ID clinic was a safe and effective alternative to home infusion or skilled nursing facilities for patients requiring long-term antibiotics with few adverse events and complications.

37942421,2023,Effectiveness of outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) for patients with cranial infection. ,"OBJECTIVE: Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) is a well-established and cost-effective method for improving the efficient use of healthcare resources. However, only a few centres in Germany perform it. Here we analysed OPAT for the treatment of patients with cranial infections in our neurosurgical department. METHODS: This retrospective study analysed patients with cranial infections and the need for intravenous (i.v.) antimicrobial treatment between 2018 and 2021.All diagnosed intracranial infections were defined into two infection categories such as long-term antimicrobial treatment and short-term antimicrobial treatment. All included patients were discharged with a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. Prior to discharge, all patients received training in the safe administration of their medications via the PICC line. The duration of OPAT and the rate of readmission after OPAT were analysed. RESULTS: We identified a total of 45 patients treated with OPAT for cranial infections. Intradural involvement was present in 40 cases (88.9%). The average length of hospital stay for this cohort after surgical treatment was 45 ± 15 days. 5 patients were treated for soft tissue/skin infection. Surgery was not required in this cohort. The mean hospital stay for this cohort was 8 ± 6 days. Gram-positive organisms were isolated in most cases (53.3%). The most common pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus followed by other Staphylococcus species. For all included patients, OPAT was performed after discharge for an average of 43.1 ± 14 days. There were five cases of readmission due to treatment failure. No serious adverse events or complications of OPAT were observed. CONCLUSION: OPAT enables better patient-centred healthcare close to home. The length of hospital stay can be reduced and adverse events due to prolonged hospitalisation can be avoided.

33019880,2021,"Safe use of Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters for chemotherapy of solid malignancies in adult patients: A 1-year monocentric, prospectively-assessed, unselected cohort of 482 patients. ","INTRODUCTION: Aim of this study was to analyze the overall complication and failure rates of Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters (PICCs), in a 1-year consecutive unselected cohort of 482 adult patients, affected by non-hematological malignancies undergoing chemotherapy. METHODS: Adult outpatients (aged 18-75 years), with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2, bearing solid tumors and candidates for intravenous chemotherapy were eligible for the study. Exclusion criteria were active infections, coagulopathy (defined as platelet count <50,000/μL and/or prothrombin time more than 18 s), life expectancy <6 months, or inability to give written informed consent. Devices were all implanted in an outpatients' hospital facility, following predefined evidence-based institutional guidelines and protocols by a PICC-dedicated team at the European Institute of Oncology in Milan, Italy, during the 12-month period from January 1 to December 31, 2019. RESULTS: Five-hundred PICCs were implanted in a cohort of 482 patients during the time interval of this study. Thirty devices were overall removed (6.2%), 23 as a consequence of a complication occurred, and seven inadvertently. The inserted PICCs accounted for a total of 49,718 catheter days in situ, median duration was 85.5 days [interquartile range (IQR): 56-146]. Overall there were 42 (8.7%) complications, corresponding to 0.84 catheter-adverse events (CAE)/1000 PICC-days (95% CI: 0.61-1.14). There were N = 13 (2.7%) thromboses, N = 11 (2.3%) irreversible occlusions, N = 7 (1.5%) accidental removals, N = 5 (1.0%) infections [two Catheter Related Blood Stream Infection (CRBSI) and three exit site/local infection], N = 3 (0.6%) ruptures and N = 3 (0.6%) primary or secondary malpositions. CONCLUSION: This large prospective study supports the increasing use of PICCs in adult oncology outpatients treated in specialized centers with chemotherapy for non-hematological malignancies. In this clinical setting, PICC failure occurred in 6% only of the inserted devices. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Adult' '*Catheter-Related Infections/diagnosis'

30348912,2018,Evaluation of a novel flushing protocol for a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) in the neurological intensive care unit: A prospective randomized study. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are increasingly used in critical care units. Venous arterial blood management protection (VAMP) for PICCs could decrease the rate of blockage of PICCs. We investigated whether a novel flushing method for PICCs could decrease the risk of venous thromboembolism (VT) and catheter-associated bloodstream infections (CABSIs) compared to the traditional flushing method. METHODS: In this prospective randomized study, we evaluated 360 patients with PICCs who were admitted to our neurological intensive care unit from March 2012 to February 201 4. The patients were randomized into the experimental group (n= 186) and the control group (n= 174). The VAMP-system flushing method was used in the experimental group whereas in the control group the PICCs were flushed with a 10 ml syringe of saline. Baseline clinical information, blockage rate of PICCs, occurrence of VT and CABSIs and average time for flushing (seconds per flushing time) were compared and analysed. RESULTS: The occurrence of CABSIs and average time for flushing were statistically lower in the experimental group. The rate of blockage of PICCs, proportion of male subjects, age of subjects, APACHE II score and length of stay in hospital showed no significant differences between the two groups. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the VAMP-system flushing method is simple to use and may be more beneficial for patients with a PICC; it may also lower the risk of CABSIs.

26109544,2015,Evaluation of the correct position of peripherally inserted central catheters: anatomical landmark vs. electrocardiographic technique. ,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to verify as early as possible the correct positioning of the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) tip in order to reduce complications due to possible malpositioning. The ECG-guided technique proved to be reliable, easy to carry out, straightforward, low-cost and allows us to recognize an incorrect or a suboptimal positioning throughout the procedure. The purpose of this study is to compare two methods used during the PICC insertion so as to prevent catheter malpositioning; the first study estimates the catheter length by the landmark method (based on cutaneous anatomical landmarks, CALs) with the addition of the postprocedural verification of tip location by chest X-Ray (CxR), whereas the second method of intraprocedural tip location is based on the observation of the morphological variations of the P wave (ECG-guided technique) with the addition of the postprocedural verification by CxR. METHODS: From 2010 to 2012, 90 PICCs were positioned, 48 using the anatomical landmarks and 42 using the ECG technique. RESULTS: Twenty-five percent of the catheters positioned with the anatomical landmark technique did not reach the correct position of the tip in SVC; of these, 6.25% were placed in an aberrant position and others in a sub-optimal position.Of the 42 PICCs positioned with the ECG technique, only in three cases (equal to 7.14%), a suboptimal position of the tip was observed, whereas there was no case of aberrant positioning. CONCLUSIONS: The ECG technique represents an accurate, low-cost and safe technique to verify the correct positioning of the tip. The use of the ECG allowed a more correct positioning in terms of catheter tip-carina distance and catheter tip-tracheobronchial angle, and in no patient was it necessary to place a catheter again.

25248408,2014,A role for peripherally inserted central venous catheters in the prevention of catheter-related blood stream infections in patients with hematological malignancies. ,"Central venous catheter-related blood stream infections (CR-BSIs) are a serious complication in patients with hematological malignancies. However, it remains unclear whether there is a difference in the rate of CR-BSI associated with the conventional type of central venous catheters (cCVCs) and peripherally inserted CVCs (PICCs) in such patients. To address this question, we retrospectively investigated the incidence of CR-BSIs associated with PICCs versus cCVCs in patients with hematological malignancies. We used PICCs in all consecutive patients requiring CVC placement between February 2009 and February 2013. We compared the CR-BSI rate in patients with PICCs with that in patients with cCVCs treated between September 2006 and January 2009 (control group). Eighty-four patients received PICCs and 85 received cCVCs. The most common reason for removal due to catheter-related complications was CR-BSI. The CR-BSI rate in the PICC group was significantly lower than that in the cCVC group (PICCs: 1.23/1000 catheter days; cCVCs: 5.30/1000 catheter days; P < 0.01). Catheter-related complications other than CR-BSIs occurred at an extremely low rate in the PICC group. The median catheter-related complication-free survival duration was significantly longer in the PICC group than in the cCVC group. Our study shows that PICCs are useful in patients with hematological malignancies. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Aged'

33084898,2020,Association of Infectious Disease Physician Approval of Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter With Appropriateness and Complications. ,"IMPORTANCE: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are frequently used to deliver intravenous antimicrobial therapy. However, inappropriate PICC use may lead to patient harm. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether infectious disease physician approval prior to PICC placement for intravenous antimicrobials is associated with more appropriate device use and fewer complications. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study of 21 653 PICCs placed for a primary indication of intravenous antimicrobial therapy between January 1, 2015, and July 26, 2019, was conducted in 42 hospitals participating in a quality collaborative across Michigan among hospitalized medical patients. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Appropriateness of PICCs was defined according to the Michigan Appropriateness Guide for Intravenous Catheters as a composite measure of (1) single-lumen catheter use, (2) avoiding use of PICCs for 5 days or less, and (3) avoiding use of PICCs for patients with chronic kidney disease (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <45 mL/min/1.73 m2). Complications related to PICCs included catheter occlusion, deep vein thrombosis, and central line-associated bloodstream infection. The association between infectious disease physician approval, device appropriateness, and catheter complications was assessed using multivariable models, adjusted for patient comorbidities and hospital clustering. Results were expressed as odds ratios with 95% CIs. RESULTS: A total of 21 653 PICCs were placed for intravenous antimicrobials (11 960 PICCs were placed in men [55.2%]; median age, 64.5 years [interquartile range, 53.4-75.4 years]); 10 238 PICCs (47.3%) were approved by an infectious disease physician prior to placement. Compared with PICCs with no documented approval, PICCs with approval by an infectious disease physician were more likely to be appropriately used (72.7% [7446 of 10 238] appropriate with approval vs 45.4% [5180 of 11 415] appropriate without approval; odds ratio, 3.53; 95% CI, 3.29-3.79; P < .001). Furthermore, approval was associated with lower odds of a PICC-related complication (6.5% [665 of 10 238] with approval vs 11.3% [1292 of 11 415] without approval; odds ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.50-0.61). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study suggests that, when PICCs were placed for intravenous antimicrobial therapy, infectious disease physician approval of PICC insertion was associated with more appropriate device use and fewer complications. Policies aimed at ensuring infectious disease physician approval prior to PICC placement for antimicrobials may improve patient safety.

31158846,2019,Use of Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters in Patients With Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease: A Prospective Cohort Study. ,"BACKGROUND: Existing guidelines, including Choosing Wisely recommendations, endorse avoiding placement of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). OBJECTIVE: To describe the frequency of and characteristics associated with PICC use in hospitalized patients with stage 3b or greater CKD (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] <45 mL/min/1.73 m2). DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: 52 hospitals participating in the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium. PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalized medical patients who received a PICC between November 2013 and September 2016. MEASUREMENTS: Percentage of patients receiving PICCs who had CKD, frequency of PICC-related complications, and variation in the proportion of PICCs placed in patients with CKD. RESULTS: Of 20 545 patients who had PICCs placed, 4743 (23.1% [95% CI, 20.9% to 25.3%]) had an estimated GFR (eGFR) less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 699 (3.4%) were receiving hemodialysis. In the intensive care unit (ICU), 30.9% (CI, 29.7% to 32.2%) of patients receiving PICCs had an eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2; the corresponding percentage in wards was 19.3% (CI, 18.8% to 19.9%). Among patients with an eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, multilumen PICCs were placed more frequently than single-lumen PICCs. In wards, PICC-related complications occurred in 15.3% of patients with an eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and in 15.2% of those with an eGFR of 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 or higher. The corresponding percentages in ICU settings were 22.4% and 23.9%. In patients with an eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, PICC placement varied widely across hospitals (interquartile range, 23.7% to 37.8% in ICUs and 12.8% to 23.7% in wards). LIMITATION: Nephrologist approval for placement could not be determined, and 2.7% of eGFR values were unknown and excluded. CONCLUSION: In this sample of hospitalized patients who received PICCs, placement in those with CKD was common and not concordant with clinical guidelines.

28634973,2017,The role of a surveillance programme for intro-ducing peripherally inserted central catheters: a 2-year observational study in an academic hospital. ,"AIMS OF THE STUDY: In our hospital, a previous attempt to introduce peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) was aborted after a nonsystematic approach, seemingly accompanied by high rates of complications. The goal of this new interdisciplinary project was to introduce PICCs in an academic hospital, with an embedded interdisciplinary surveillance programme for both infectious and noninfectious outcomes. METHODS: We prospectively collected data for this surveillance study from all patients who underwent PICC insertion from 1 January 2014 and had the catheter removed by 31 December 2015 in our 950-bed academic hospital (Bern University Hospital, Switzerland). Infectious complications were defined according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention / National Healthcare Safety Network criteria. PICCs were restricted to cancer and infectious disease patients, and were followed up irrespective of the management setting (inpatient, outpatient or intermittently hospitalised after insertion). An interdisciplinary team reviewed the outcomes on a routine basis and discussed changes to the process to improve outcomes, if necessary. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-five PICCs were inserted in 124 patients, the majority of whom were patients from the medical oncology department (n = 107, 86.3%). Indications for PICC insertion included: chemotherapy (n = 97, 71.9%), antibiotic therapy (n = 24, 17.8%), total parenteral nutrition (n = 8, 5.9%), blood product transfusion (n = 4, 3.0%) and palliative care (n = 2, 1.5%). During a total of 10 402 catheter-days (median dwell time 62 days), there were five central line-associated bloodstream infections, including one mucosal barrier injury laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection and two exit-site infections, yielding incidence rates of 0.48 and 0.19 infections per 1000 catheter-days, respectively. Incidence rates were 0.67 per 1000 catheter-days (n = 7) for radiologically documented deep venous thrombosis, 0.96 (n = 10) for tip dislocation and 0.67 (n = 7) for catheter occlusion. The overall rate of complications was 4.5 per 1000 catheter-days. Seventeen catheters (12.6%) were removed because of any complication. CONCLUSION: We successfully introduced PICCs in an academic hospital by implementing a systematic surveillance programme for complications. Both infectious and noninfectious complications were rare. Infection prevention specialists should be actively involved during the introduction of new intravascular devices in order to provide quality indicators and assure patient safety.

31236782,2020,Sequential Pneumatic Compression in the Arm in Neurocritical Patients with a Peripherally Inserted Central Venous Catheter: A Randomized Trial. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) are increasingly used for parenteral access in critically ill hospitalized patients, but they increase the incidence of upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (UE DVT). Sequential compression devices (SCDs) applied to the legs effectively reduce lower extremity DVT, but have not been tested in the arms. Our objective was to determine whether SCDs applied to the arm may reduce the risk of PICC-associated UE DVT. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of randomized, single-center, controlled clinical trial on patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit with critical neurological illness who had a PICC and were not receiving anticoagulants. Between January 2014 and October 2016, patients were randomized 1:1 to an intervention group having a custom SCD applied to the arm harboring the PICC or to a control group. The primary endpoint was ultrasound-detected UE DVT. RESULTS: Following randomization of 77 subjects, the study was terminated due to excess DVT in the treatment arm. UE DVT was detected in 18 subjects (29.0%), and it was more frequent among those in the SCD group (13/31 [41.9%] vs. the control group 5/31 [16.1%]; p = 0.049). After accounting for crossovers, the difference was still significant (12/28 [43.0%] vs. 6/34 [17.6%]; p = 0.048). Yet, symptomatic UE DVT (n = 3) and pulmonary embolism without evidence of lower extremity DVT (n = 2) were only observed in patients who were not wearing the SCD on the arm. CONCLUSIONS: Although UE DVT is commonly associated with PICC use, the results of this trial do not support the use of SCD on the arm for DVT prevention. Further research on this strategy may nonetheless be justified. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov under the identifier NCT01670188.

28823518,2017,Rivaroxaban in the Treatment of PICC-associated Upper Extremity Venous Thrombosis. ,"PURPOSE: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are frequently used for prolonged drug administration, but their use is commonly complicated by the development of upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (UEDVT) requiring anticoagulation. Here, we compared the efficacy and safety profile of rivaroxaban (20 mg/d) with low molecular weight (LMW) heparin and vitamin K antagonists in the treatment of PICC-associated UEDVT. METHODS: Patients (N = 84) with PICC-associated UEDVT were studied. All had UEDVT identified by ultrasound scanning. Further ultrasound images were obtained at 1, 2, and 3 months after the start of treatment. Forty-four patients were treated with rivaroxaban and 40 with initial LMW heparin and vitamin K antagonist with continuation of vitamin K antagonists alone once international normalized ratio was therapeutic FINDINGS: In the rivaroxaban group mean (SD) age was 51 (16) years and 57% were men, whereas in the other group respective values were 50 (16) years and 56%. All patients were receiving treatment for cancer. Resolution of thrombus had occurred in 53.5% at 1 month, 76.1% at 2 months, and 92.6% at 3 months in the rivaroxaban-treated patients. Corresponding values in the LMW heparin/vitamin antagonist-treated patients were 34.2%, 55.5%, and 88.5%, respectively. Differences between groups were significant at 1 month (P < 0.01) and 2 months (P < 0.05). There were no major bleeds in either group, and cumulative bleeding rates by 3 months were 7.3% in the rivaroxaban group and 11.4% in the LMW heparin/vitamin K antagonist group. IMPLICATIONS: Rivaroxaban led to faster resolution of PICC-associated UEDVT than LMW/vitamin K antagonists without any increase in bleeding.

34570003,2022,Ultrasound-Guided Peripheral Intravenous Catheter Insertion Training Reduces Use of Midline Catheters in Hospitalized Patients With Difficult Intravenous Access. ,"OBJECTIVES: Difficult intravenous (IV) access (DIVA) is a prevalent condition in the hospital setting and increases utilization of midline catheters (MCs) and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs). Ultrasound-guided peripheral intravenous (USGPIV) insertion is effective at establishing intravenous access in DIVA but remains understudied in the inpatient setting. We evaluated the effect of an USGPIV simulation-based mastery learning (SBML) curriculum for nurses on MC and PICC utilization for hospitalized patients. METHODS: We performed a quasi-experimental observational study. We trained nurses across all inpatient units at a large tertiary care hospital. We queried the electronic medical record to compare PICC and MC utilization for patients with DIVA during 3 periods: before USGPIV SBML training (control), during pilot testing of the intervention, and during the SBML intervention. To account for variations in insertion practices over time, we performed an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis between 2 periods, the combined control and pilot periods and the intervention period. RESULTS: One hundred forty-eight nurses completed USGPIV SBML training. Midline catheters inserted monthly per 1000 patient-days for DIVA decreased significantly from 1.86 ± 0.51 (control) to 2.31 ± 0.28 (pilot) to 1.33 ± 0.51 (intervention; P = 0.001). The ITS analysis indicated a significant intervention effect (P < 0.001). Peripherally inserted central catheters inserted monthly per 1000 patient-days for DIVA also significantly decreased over the study periods; however, the ITS failed to show an intervention effect as PICC insertions were already decreasing during the control period. CONCLUSIONS: A hospital-wide USGPIV SBML curriculum for inpatient nurses was associated with a significant reduction in MCs inserted for DIVA.

32769376,2022,Complete Blood Count Collected Via Venipuncture Versus Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter in Hematological Patients: A Comparison of 2 Methods. ,"BACKGROUND: The use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in cancer care is increasing over traditional central venous catheters. Nurses frequently collect blood by venipuncture when a PICC is inserted, as there is no available evidence to confirm the reliability of blood tests collected through PICCs in adults. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the reliability of blood samples for complete blood count (CBC) obtained through PICCs as an alternative to venipuncture. METHODS: A cross-sectional design was used to recruit adult hematological patients. The blood samples were collected within 5 minutes of each other by a specialist nurse. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count were evaluated. To determine method comparison, Passing-Bablok regression, test of linearity, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, and Bland-Altman plots were used. RESULTS: Thirty paired blood samples were collected in 29 hematological patients with a mean age of 66.8 years. A statistical difference was found for hemoglobin (P = .001) and hematocrit (P = .001) levels, but no clinical difference. The regression models revealed no systematic differences and no proportional differences with a linear relationship between the methods. Bland-Altman plots highlighted a good agreement between methods. CONCLUSION: Blood samples for CBC drawn by PICCs are as reliable as those collected via venipuncture. Blood sampling via PICC could be recommended in people with hematological malignancies in needs of frequent blood tests. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Sampling through a PICC provides reliable laboratory results for CBC, and it could reduce patients' discomfort and increase the safety of professionals reducing the risk of accidental percutaneous needlestick injuries.

This study had 2 objectives: to estimate the incidence of upper extremity venous thrombosis associated with PICCs in oncology patients and to evaluate the role of Doppler sonography in antithrombotic prophylaxis. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study with each patient being followed for 6 weeks. From April 2014 to October 2014, we analyzed a series of 245 consecutive oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy via PICCs, for an overall number of 246 PICC placements. We assessed the role of Doppler sonography for initiation of antithrombotic prophylaxis. The study group encompassed 2 cohorts of patients: those who received regular weekly Doppler screening for thrombosis prophylaxis and those who did not. RESULTS: Of 246 insertions, we observed 90 episodes of upper extremity venous thrombosis (36.59%); 62 of them were asymptomatic in the Doppler group, and 28 were symptomatic in the no-Doppler group. Patients in the Doppler group had a significantly lower rate of thrombosis (0%) than those in the no-Doppler group (23.53%; P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Our prospective study suggests that the rate of PICC-related upper extremity venous thrombosis in oncology patients is high, and the occurrence of symptomatic thrombosis could be lowered with regular weekly Doppler screening after PICC insertions.

25907772,2015,Use of double-lumen peripherally inserted central catheters for safer perioperative management of esophageal cancer patients. ,"PURPOSE: As a step to large-scale clinical trials, we conducted a small-scale exploratory study to clarify whether the secondary lumen of the double-lumen (DL) peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) could perform as well as the secondary lumen of the DL centrally inserted central catheters (CICCs), with an acceptable complication rate in the perioperative surgery period. METHODS: Forty thoracic esophageal cancer patients requiring central venous catheterization during the perioperative period were assigned to the DL-PICC (4.5-French, 60-cm) group or the DL-CICC (16-gauge, 30-cm) group, with 1:1 randomization. The primary endpoint was the completion rate of continuous catecholamine infusion via the secondary lumen during the observation period. RESULTS: Thirty-two cases (14 cases in the PICC group and 18 cases in the CICC group) were analyzed. Continuous catecholamine infusion via the secondary lumen was completed in all 32 cases. No major complications related to PICC/CICC placement/maintenance were noted in the groups during the median observation period of 6 days. CONCLUSIONS: The secondary lumen of the DL-PICCs performed as well as the secondary lumen of the DL-CICCs with acceptable safety during the relatively short perioperative period of these thoracic esophageal cancer patients (UMIN Clinical Trial Registry UMIN000008131).

22948189,2013,Comparison of catheter-related large vein thrombosis in centrally inserted versus peripherally inserted central venous lines in the neurological intensive care unit. ,"OBJECTIVE: To compare cumulative complication rates of peripherally (PICC) and centrally (CICVC) inserted central venous catheters, including catheter-related large vein thrombosis (CRLVT), central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), and line insertion-related complications in neurological intensive care patients. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study and detailed chart review for 431 consecutive PICCs and 141 CICVCs placed in patients under neurological intensive care from March 2008 through February 2010. Cumulative incidence of CRLVT, CLABSI, and line insertion-related complications were compared between PICC and CICVC groups. Risk factors for CRLVT including mannitol therapy during dwell time, previous history of venous thromboembolism, surgery longer than 1h during dwell time, and line placement in a paretic arm were also compared between groups. RESULTS: During the study period, 431 unique PICCs were placed with cumulative incidence of symptomatic thrombosis of 8.4%, CLABSI 2.8%, and line insertion-related complications 0.0%. During the same period, 141 unique CICVCs were placed with cumulative incidence of symptomatic thrombosis of 1.4%, CLABSI 1.4%, and line insertion-related complications 0.7%. There was a statistically significant difference in CRLVT with no difference in CLABSI or line insertion-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: In neurological critical care patients, CICVCs appear to have a better risk profile compared to PICCs, with a decreased risk of CRLVT. As use of PICCs in critical care patients increases, a prospective randomized trial comparing PICCs and CICVCs in neurological critical care patients is necessary to assist in choosing the appropriate catheter and to minimize risks of morbidity and mortality associated with central venous access.

38157768,2023,Safety of non-cuffed tunneled central venous catheters in adults with cystic fibrosis. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are the most common route of intravenous (I.V.) access for treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) pulmonary exacerbations, but repeated PICC placement can result in upper extremity peripheral venous stenosis. Once peripheral stenosis develops, a non-cuffed tunneled central venous catheter (NcTCVC) is an alternative route for IV access. While these are regularly used at some CF centers, the safety and complication rate compared to PICCs in adults with CF has not been reported. This study aims to describe the safety of NcTCVCs in adults with CF. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed at a CF Foundation accredited institution including adults with CF who received NcTCVCs in interventional radiology from 7/19/2007 to 3/09/2020. Complications analyzed included catheter related deep venous thrombosis (DVT), central line associated blood stream infection (CLABSI), and catheter related central venous stenosis. Complications were considered attributable if they occurred while the catheter was in place or within 30 days of catheter removal. RESULTS: During the study duration, 386 NcTCVCs were placed in 60 unique patients (55 % female) with a mean of 6.4 catheters per patient. Majority of NcTCVCs placed were 4 French (61.4 %). Average duration of indwelling NcTCVC was 16.2 days. No patients demonstrated catheter attributable symptomatic DVT. The incidence of DVT, CLABSI, and central venous stenosis was 0 (0 %), 4 (1 %), and 1 (0.3 %), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Many adults with CF have required insertion of numerous PICCs for the treatment of recurrent pulmonary exacerbations. In those adults that develop PICC-associated peripheral vein stenosis precluding PICC placement, these results indicate NcTCVCs are a safe alternative.

34177272,2021,Predictable Risk Factors of Upper-Extremity Deep Venous Thrombosis in a Level I Trauma Center. ,"BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in hospital patients, especially that of the lower extremities. Risk factors and diagnostic elements of upper-extremity deep-vein thrombosis (UEDVT) are poorly understood compared to those of the lower extremities. The primary objectives of this study were to identify predictive risk factors of secondary UEDVT. METHODS: This retrospective study included all nonpregnant patients aged >18 years who had undergone upper-extremity duplex scans to check for the presence of secondary UEDVT at Richmond University Medical Center from January 2014 to March 2020. Patients were stratified by presence or absence of UEDVT. Collected data points included patient demographics, comorbidities, central-line use, platelet count at time of scan, length of stay, and overall mortality. IBM 27.0 was used for all statistical analysis, with p<0.05 considered significant. RESULTS: A total of 1,009 upper extremity venous duplex studies were included. There were no significant differences in age, sex, race, or mean platelet levels between patients diagnosed with DVT and those without (p<0.05). After multinomial regression analysis, central venous catheter (CVC; 26.8% versus 78.5%, aOR 1.770, 95% CI 1.150-2.725; p<0.002), peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line (17.5% versus 82.5%, aOR3.254, 95% CI 1.997-5.304; p<0.001), hypertension (67.8% versus 28.8%, aOR 1.641, 95% CI 1.136-2.369; p<0.001), chronic kidney disease (CKD; 34.5% versus 65.5%, aOR 1.743, 95% CI 1.201-2.531; p<0.001), and malignancy (27.1% versus 74.6%, aOR 1.475, 95% CI 0.994-2.190; p<0.053) were found to be independent predictors of UEDVT. CONCLUSION: Use of CVC or PICC line, preexisting diagnosis of hypertension, malignancy, and CKD were independent risk factors of UEDVT, while there was no significant correlation between increased platelet levels and UEDVT.

28822403,2017,Inpatient Peripherally Inserted Central Venous Catheter Complications: Should Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter Lines Be Placed in the Intensive Care Unit Setting? ,"Peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) are now commonly used for central access in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting; however, there is a paucity of data evaluating the complication rates associated with these lines. We performed a retrospective review of all PICCs placed in the inpatient setting at our institution during a 1-year period from January 2013 to December 2013. These were divided into two groups: those placed at the bedside in the ICU and those placed by interventional radiology in non-ICU patients. Data regarding infectious and thrombotic complications were collected and evaluated. During the study period, 1209 PICC line placements met inclusion criteria and were evaluated; 1038 were placed by interventional radiology in non-ICU patients, and 171 were placed at the bedside in ICU patients. The combined thrombotic and central line associated blood stream infection rate was 6.17 per cent in the non-ICU group and 10.53 per cent in the ICU group (P = 0.035). The thrombotic complication rate was 5.88 per cent in the non-ICU group and 7.60 per cent in the ICU group (P = 0.38), whereas the central line associated blood stream infection rate was 0.29 per cent in the non-ICU group and 2.92 per cent in the ICU group (P = 0.002). This study seems to suggest that PICC lines placed at the bedside in the ICU setting are associated with higher complication rates, in particular infectious complications, than those placed by interventional radiology in non-ICU patients. The routine placement of PICC lines in the ICU settings needs to be reevaluated given these findings. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Adolescent' 'Adult' 'Aged' 'Aged, 80 and over'

27397766,2016,The Midline Catheter: A Clinical Review. ,"BACKGROUND: Venous access in the emergency department (ED) is an often under-appreciated procedural skill given the frequency of its use. The patient's clinical status, ongoing need for laboratory investigation, and intravenous therapeutics guide the size, type, and placement of the catheter. The availability of trained personnel and dedicated teams using ultrasound-guided insertion techniques in technically difficult situations may also impact the selection. Appropriate device selection is warranted on initial patient contact to minimize risk and cost. OBJECTIVE: To compare venous access device indications and complications, highlighting the use of midline catheters as a potentially cost-effective and safe approach for venous access in the ED. DISCUSSION: Midline catheters (MC) offer a comparable rate of device-related bloodstream infection to standard peripheral intravenous catheters (PIV), but with a significantly lower rate than peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) and central venous catheters (CVC) (PIV 0.2/1000, MC 0.5/1000, PICC 2.1-2.3/1000, CVC 2.4-2.7/1000 catheter days). The average dwell time of a MC is reported as 7.69-16.4 days, which far exceeds PIVs (2.9-4.1 days) and is comparable to PICCs (7.3-16.6 days). Cost of insertion of a MC has been cited as comparable to three PIVs, and their use has been associated with significant cost savings when placed to avoid prolonged central venous access with CVCs or in patients with difficult-to-access peripheral veins. Placement of a MC includes modified Seldinger and accelerated, or all-in-one, Seldinger techniques with or without ultrasound guidance, with a high rate of first-attempt success. CONCLUSION: The MC is a versatile venous access device with a low complication rate, long dwell time, and high rate of first-attempt placement. Its utilization in the ED in patients deemed to require prolonged hospitalization or to have difficult-to-access peripheral vasculature could reduce cost and risk to patients.

We sought to describe these factors and hypothesized that dialysis patients would comprise a significant proportion of this cohort. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study from January 2010 to December 2011. SETTING: An 880-bed tertiary teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Patients with CLABSI in non-ICU wards. METHODS: CLABSI patients were identified from existing infection-control databases and primary chart review was conducted. National Health and Safety Network (NHSN) definitions were utilized for CLABSI and pathogen classification. CLABSI rates were calculated per patient day. Total mortality rates were inclusive of hospice patients. RESULTS: Over a 2-year period, 104 patients incurred 113 CLABSIs for an infection rate of 0.35 per 1,000 patient days. The mean length of hospital stay prior to CLABSI was 16±13.3 days, which was nearly 3 times that of hospital-wide non-ICU length of stay. Only 11 patients (10.6%) received dialysis within 48 hours of CLABSI. However, 67% of patients had a hematologic malignancy, and 91.8% of those admitted with a malignant hematologic diagnosis were neutropenic at the time of CLABSI. Enterococcus spp. was the most common organism recovered, and half of all central venous catheters (CVCs) present were peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC lines). Mortality rates were 18.3% overall and 27.3% among dialysis patients. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CLABSIs outside of the ICU, only 10.6% received dialysis prior to infection. However, underlying hematologic malignancy, neutropenia, and PICC lines were highly prevalent in this population.

26368787,2015,Assessing the economic value of avoiding hospital admissions by shifting the management of gram+ acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections to an outpatient care setting. ,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate, from a US payer perspective, the cost offsets of treating gram positive acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (ABSSSI) with varied hospital length of stay (LOS) followed by outpatient care, as well as the cost implications of avoiding hospital admission. METHODS: Economic drivers of care were estimated using a literature-based economic model incorporating inpatient and outpatient components. The model incorporated equal efficacy, adverse events (AE), resource use, and costs from literature. Costs of once- and twice-daily outpatient infusions to achieve a 14-day treatment were analyzed. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Costs were adjusted to 2015 US$. RESULTS: Total non-drug medical cost for treatment of ABSSSI entirely in the outpatient setting to avoid hospital admission was the lowest among all scenarios and ranged from $4039-$4924. Total non-drug cost for ABSSSI treated in the inpatient setting ranged from $9813 (3 days LOS) to $18,014 (7 days LOS). Inpatient vs outpatient cost breakdown was: 3 days inpatient ($6657)/11 days outpatient ($3156-$3877); 7 days inpatient ($15,017)/7 days outpatient ($2495-$2997). Sensitivity analyses revealed a key outpatient cost driver to be peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) costs (average per patient cost of $873 for placement and $205 for complications). LIMITATIONS: Drug and indirect costs were excluded and resource use was not differentiated by ABSSSI type. It was assumed that successful ABSSSI treatment takes up to 14 days per the product labels, and that once-daily and twice-daily antibiotics have equal efficacy. CONCLUSION: Shifting ABSSSI care to outpatient settings may result in medical cost savings greater than 53%. Typical outpatient scenarios represent 14-37% of total medical cost, with PICC accounting for 28-43% of the outpatient burden. The value of new ABSSSI therapies will be driven by eliminating the need for PICC line, reducing length of stay and the ability to completely avoid a hospital stay.

28218363,2017,"Sex, race, and hemodialysis vascular access processes. ","PURPOSE: Hemodialysis (HD) patients who are female or black receive fewer arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) and more grafts (AVG). We evaluated race- and sex-based differences for three process exposures: access surgery, peripherally-inserted central catheters (PICCs), and vascular imaging. METHODS: US Renal Data System with linked Medicare claims for patients initiating HD between April 2010 - December 2011 were used to identify PICC placement, imaging, AVF and AVG surgeries, and the vascular accesses in use at individual HD treatments. Poisson, logistic, and Cox regression models adjusted for clinical and demographic variables were used to evaluate relationships between process exposures, vascular access outcomes, and sex. RESULTS: Among 18,883 individuals initiating HD with catheters with at least one surgical claim for AVF or AVG, women had 16% more PICC and 5% more imaging (p = 0.002), were 43% less likely to have AVF surgery and 68% more likely to have AVG surgery (p<0.001). The odds of AVF surgery producing a working AVF were 18% lower and of AVG surgery producing a working AVG 38% higher (p<0.001). Black patients had 24% more PICCs and 12% more imaging, were 48% less likely to have AVF surgery and 84% more likely to have AVG surgery (p<0.001). The odds of achieving a working AVF were 8% lower and of a working AVG were 38% higher. The hazard of future catheter use after AVF creation was 25% higher for women (p<0.001), but did not differ by race. CONCLUSIONS: Divergences in vascular access by race and sex were partly related to differential process exposures. Black and female patients had more AVG and less AVF surgery, and more PICC and imaging. Success rates were lower for AVF surgery and higher for AVG surgery. Further work is needed to determine whether choices of process exposures arise from differential ability to detect veins on physical examination.

30081959,2018,Risk factors for readmission in patients discharged with outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy: a retrospective cohort study. ,"BACKGROUND: Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) is a practical and effective way of delivering antimicrobial therapy, but may be associated with significant risk for hospital readmission. This study aimed to elucidate risk factors related to 30-day readmissions in patients who were discharged with OPAT at Mount Sinai Beth Israel (MSBI). METHODS: This IRB approved retrospective cohort study included patients who were at least 18 years or older, admitted to MSBI from August 2015 to March 2016, and discharged to receive OPAT. Patients with intravenous antibiotics prescribed for chronic suppression or planned readmission within 30 days were excluded. The main outcome was readmission to the hospital within 30 days from previous hospital discharge. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were performed to determine predictors of 30-day readmission. RESULTS: There were a total of 200 patients included in the analysis; the median age was 60 years, 65.5% were male, and the median Charlson score was 2. A total of 155 (78%) patients received a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC); the remainder was discharged with a midline. The most common medications prescribed for OPAT included cephalosporins (41%), vancomycin (31%), carbapenems (23%), and penicillins (16%). A total of 42 patients (21%) were readmitted within 30 days after previous discharge. Discharge to a skilled nursing facility or subacute rehabilitation center was found to be an independent predictor of readmission on logistic regression analyses (p <  0.05). CONCLUSION: Readmissions are common in patients discharged with OPAT. Recognizing predictors of readmission may help determine strategies to optimize care.

27957644,2017,Tip malposition of peripherally inserted central catheters: a prospective randomized controlled trial to compare bedside insertion to fluoroscopically guided placement. ,"OBJECTIVE: Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) use continues to increase, leading to the development of a blind bedside technique (BST) for placement. The aim of our study was to compare the BST with the fluoroscopically guided technique (FGT), with specific regard to catheter tip position (CTP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred eighty patients were randomized to either the BST or the FGT. All procedures were done by the same interventional team and included postprocedural chest X-ray to assess CTP. Depending on the international guidelines for optimal CTP, patients were classified in three types: optimal, suboptimal not needing repositioning, and nonoptimal requiring additional repositioning procedures. Fisher's test was used for comparisons. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-one PICCs were successful inserted. In the BST groups, 23.3% of placements were suboptimal and 30% nonoptimal, requiring repositioning. In the FGT group, 5.6% were suboptimal and 1.1% nonoptimal. Thus, suboptimal and nonoptimal CTP were significantly lower in the FGT group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Tip malposition rates are high when using blind BST, exposing the patient to an increased risk of deep venous thrombosis and catheter malfunction. Using the FGT or emerging technologies that could help tip positioning are recommended, especially for long-term indications. KEY POINTS: • Bedside and fluoroscopy guided techniques are commonly used for PICC placement. • Catheter malposition is the major technical issue with the bedside technique. • Catheter malposition occurred in 53% of patients with the bedside technique.

24464053,2014,Reducing PICC migrations and improving patient outcomes. ,Inadvertent migration of central venous catheters can lead to several issues including delayed therapy and clinical morbidities such as thrombosis. Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are particularly at risk of movement. An innovative new device which allows anchorage of the catheter has proved very successful in the minimisation of catheter migration. The SecurAcath device incorporates a small blunt anchor which lies beneath the skin in order to secure the catheter in place and prevent inadvertent movement. An evaluation of 31 patients with a SecurAcath device in situ to secure a PICC found only one case of insignificant catheter migration. Some initial problems with infection and pain were encountered and interventions were put in place to minimise their incidence. SecurAcath removal proved to be the most significant challenge but this can be overcome with suitable guidance and training. ,['eng'],['Clinical Trial' 'Journal Article'],"['Acute Pain/nursing/prevention & control' 'Adult' 'Bandages'

26369828,2015,The Michigan Appropriateness Guide for Intravenous Catheters (MAGIC): Results From a Multispecialty Panel Using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method. ,"Use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) has grown substantially in recent years. Increasing use has led to the realization that PICCs are associated with important complications, including thrombosis and infection. Moreover, some PICCs may not be placed for clinically valid reasons. Defining appropriate indications for insertion, maintenance, and care of PICCs is thus important for patient safety. An international panel was convened that applied the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method to develop criteria for use of PICCs. After systematic reviews of the literature, scenarios related to PICC use, care, and maintenance were developed according to patient population (for example, general hospitalized, critically ill, cancer, kidney disease), indication for insertion (infusion of peripherally compatible infusates vs. vesicants), and duration of use (≤5 days, 6 to 14 days, 15 to 30 days, or ≥31 days). Within each scenario, appropriateness of PICC use was compared with that of other venous access devices. After review of 665 scenarios, 253 (38%) were rated as appropriate, 124 (19%) as neutral/uncertain, and 288 (43%) as inappropriate. For peripherally compatible infusions, PICC use was rated as inappropriate when the proposed duration of use was 5 or fewer days. Midline catheters and ultrasonography-guided peripheral intravenous catheters were preferred to PICCs for use between 6 and 14 days. In critically ill patients, nontunneled central venous catheters were preferred over PICCs when 14 or fewer days of use were likely. In patients with cancer, PICCs were rated as appropriate for irritant or vesicant infusion, regardless of duration. The panel of experts used a validated method to develop appropriate indications for PICC use across patient populations. These criteria can be used to improve care, inform quality improvement efforts, and advance the safety of medical patients.

23633980,2013,Upper extremity venous thrombosis in patients with cancer with peripherally inserted central venous catheters: a retrospective analysis of risk factors. ,"PURPOSE: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are often used in place of mediport catheters because of cost and lack of operating room time and to prevent delays in therapy. One common complication associated with their use is upper extremity venous thrombosis (UEVT). The purpose of this study was to ascertain risk factors associated with an increased risk of PICC-associated UEVT in patients with cancer. METHODS: Retrospective analysis identified 237 patients with cancer who received PICCs at the Dallas Veterans Affairs Medical Center from 2006 to 2009. We analyzed many risk factors, including PICC infection (PI), use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), antiplatelet agents (APAs), treatment dose anticoagulation (TDA), and bevacizumab. RESULTS: Of 237 patients, 36 (15%) were found to have UEVT. Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed risk factors positively associated with UEVT were use of ESAs (odds ratio [OR], 10.66; 95% CI, 2.25 to 50.49), hospitalization (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.05 to 5.39), PI (OR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.03 to 5.86), and TDA (OR, 8.34; 95% CI, 2.98 to 23.33), whereas patients receiving APAs had a lower risk of UEVT (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.92). CONCLUSION: Specific factors significantly increase the risk of UEVT in patients with cancer with PICCs, whereas use of APAs seems to have a protective effect against UEVT. These results may aid in the development of a predictive model for identifying patients at high risk of UEVT who may benefit from APAs, as well as in determining preventive strategies for reducing the risk of PICC-associated UEVT.

32043739,2020,Catheter-related thrombosis incidence and risk factors in adult cancer patients with central venous access devices. ,"BACKGROUND: Central venous access devices (CVAD) are commonly employed in the management of cancer patients. While having several benefits they are associated with significant risks. AIM: To review the incidence and risk factors for catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) in cancer patients with a CVAD. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational cohort study of adult patients with cancer requiring a CVAD between 1 January 2004 and 29 June 2016. The rate of, and risk factors for the development of, symptomatic CRT were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 4920 central lines was inserted into 3130 patients. The incidence of CRT was 3.6%. CRT developed a median of 12 days following line insertion. Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) were associated with the highest rates of CRT (hazards ratio (HR) 22.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.9-170.6). Older age groups developed CRT at lower rates (HR 0.57; 95% CI 0.39-0.84 for age 50-61 years, and HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.45-0.89 for age >61 years) compared to age <50 years. Increased CRT was seen in patients with prior CRT (HR 1.81; 95% CI 1.19-2.77). There was a trend to more CRT events with a Khorana tumour score of 1 compared to those with a score of 0 (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.00-1.88). Hodgkin lymphoma, germ cell and oesophagus cancers had the highest CRT rates. Side of insertion was not associated with thrombosis risk (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.57-1.05; P = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Age <50 years, PICC lines and prior CRT were associated with highest CRT rate. Cancer subtype and insertion side were not predictive of thrombosis.

23354238,2013,"Which central venous catheters have the highest rate of catheter-associated deep venous thrombosis: a prospective analysis of 2,128 catheter days in the surgical intensive care unit. ","BACKGROUND: Catheter-associated deep venous thromboses (CADVTs) are a common occurrence in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU), necessitating central venous catheter (CVC) removal and replacement. Previous studies evaluating risk factors for CADVT in SICU patients are limited, and most lack a true denominator of all CVC days. We sought to determine the true incidence of and risk factors for CADVT based on patient characteristics as well as CVC site, type, and duration of insertion. METHODS: The following data from all SICU patients in two urban Level I trauma centers were prospectively collected from 2009 to 2012: demographics, risk factors for DVT, CVC site/type/duration, and duplex results. Sites included the subclavian (SC), internal jugular (IJ), arm (for peripherally inserted central catheter [PICC] lines), and femoral. Types included multilumen (ML), introducer/hemodialysis (I/HD), and PICC. High-risk patients received weekly screening duplex examinations and a CADVT was defined as a DVT being detected on duplex with a CVC in place or within 7 days of removal. Rates of CADVT were normalized per 1,000 CVC days, and independent predictors of CADVT were determined using logistic regression. RESULTS: Data were complete for 184 patients, 354 CVCs, and 2,128 CVC days. Fifty-nine CADVTs were diagnosed in 28% of patients. Rates of CADVT were 9 per 1,000 catheter days for SC, 61 for IJ (p < 0.01 vs. SC), 27 for arm (p < 0.01), 36 for femoral (p < 0.01), 22 for ML, 57 for I/HD (p < 0.01 vs. ML), and 27 for PICC (p = 0.24). After adjusting for patient risk factors, predictors of CADVT included the IJ and arm sites (odds ratio, 6.0 and 3.0 compared with SC) and the I/HD type (odds ratio, 2.6 compared with ML, all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The IJ and arm sites and I/HD type are associated with increased CADVT. These data may be used to determine the optimal site and type of CVC for insertion.

35570386,2022,Intervention efficacy of MARSI nursing management on skin injury at peripherally inserted central catheter insertion site on oncological patients. ,"To evaluate the intervention efficacy of medical adhesive-related skin injury (MARSI) nursing management at peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) insertion site on oncological patients. This study used the case-control research method. We randomly divided 156 patients with PICCs implanted in our hospital's surgery department from January 2019 to December 2020 into a control group (85 patients) and an intervention group (71 patients). The control group was the conventional nursing care group, and the intervention group was the MARSI nursing management group. Through implementing a series of interventions (ie, risk assessment, risk prevention, and risk management) for the MARSI nursing care management group, the incidence rate of MARSI, and its types (including mechanical injury, dermatitis, maceration, and folliculitis) were compared between the two groups. The total incidence rate of MARSI was 30.59% in the control group and 7.04% in the intervention group (P < .05), and the difference was statistically significant. The incidence rate of mechanical injury in the control group was 12.94%, which decreased to 2.82% after intervention (P < .05), and the difference was statistically significant. The incidence rate of dermatitis in the intervention group was 11.76%, which decreased to 2.82% after intervention (P < .05), and the difference was statistically significant. By implementing MARSI nursing care management, the incidence rate of MARSI at PICC insertion site can be effectively reduced. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Humans' 'Adhesives'

34981151,2022,"Upper Extremity Deep Venous Thrombosis Risk Factors, Associated Morbidity and Mortality in Trauma Patients. ","BACKGROUND: The literature on upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (UEDVT) is not as abundant as that on lower extremities. This study aimed to identify the risk factors for UEDVT, associated mortality and morbidity in trauma patients and the impact of pharmacological prophylaxis therein. METHODS: A 3-year retrospective review of patients admitted to a Level 1 trauma center was conducted. Patients aged 18 years or older who had experienced a traumatic event and had undergone an upper extremity ultrasound (UEUS) were included in the study. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors that contributed to UEDVT. RESULTS: A total of 6,607 patients were admitted due to traumatic injuries during the study period, of whom 5.6% (373) had at least one UEUS during their hospitalization. Fifty-six (15%) were diagnosed with an UEDVT, as well as three non-fatal pulmonary emboli (PE) and four (7.1%) deaths, p = 0.03. Pharmacological prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin showed a protective effect against UEDVT; among the patients positive for UEDVT, 14 of 186 patients (7.5%) received LMWH, while 42 of 195 (21.5%) did not receive LMWH (p < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression revealed that the presence of upper extremity fractures, peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines, and traumatic brain injury (TBI) were independent risk factors for UEDVT. CONCLUSIONS: UEDVT are associated with a higher mortality. The presence of upper extremity fractures, PICC lines, and TBI were independent risk factors for UEDVTs. Further, pharmacological prophylaxis reduces the risk of UEDVT. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Adolescent' 'Heparin' '*Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight/therapeutic use'

Therefore, we aimed to explore the epidemiological characteristics of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), and to evaluate whether PICCs were associated with a protective effect for CLABSI. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in teaching hospital in Western China. All adult patients received a CVC or PICC during their hospital stay were included from January 2017 to December 2020. Primary endpoint was CLABSI up to 30 days after CVC or PICC placement. Propensity scores with a 2:1 match was used to account for potential confounders, and restricted cubic spline was used to visualize the risk of CLABSI at different time points during the catheterization. RESULTS: A total of 224687 devices (180522 PICCs and 45965 CVCs) in 24879 patients were included. The overall incidence was 1.8 CLABSIs per 1000 catheter-days. The odds ratio (OR) value increased day by day after PICC insertion, reached a relatively high point on the 4th day, and decreased from days 5 through 8. From the 9th day of intubation the OR value began to gradually increase day by day again. After covariate adjustment using propensity scores, CVCs were associated with higher risk of CLABSI (adjHR = 3.27, 95% CI 2.38-4.49) compared with PICCs. CONCLUSIONS: PICCs have a protective role and the effect of fluctuation curve feature in CLABSI when compared to CVCs, and the first 8 calendar days after CVC insertion are the acute stage of CVC-associated BSI.

30111976,2018,Perceptions of vascular access for intravenous systemic therapy and risk factors for lymphedema in early-stage breast cancer-a patient survey. ,"BACKGROUND: The choice of vascular access for systemic therapy administration in breast cancer remains an area of clinical equipoise, and patient preference is not consistently acknowledged. Using a patient survey, we evaluated the patient experience with vascular access during treatment for early-stage breast cancer and explored perceived risk factors for lymphedema. METHODS: Patients who had received systemic therapy for early-stage breast cancer were surveyed at 2 Canadian cancer centres. RESULTS: Responses were received from 187 patients (94%). The route of vascular access was peripheral intravenous line (IV) in 24%, a peripherally inserted central catheter (picc) in 42%, and a surgically inserted central catheter (port) in 34%. Anthracycline-based regimens were associated with a greater use of central vascular access devices (cvads- that is, a picc or port; 86/97, 89%). Trastuzumab use was associated with greater use of ports (49/64, 77%). Although few patients (7%) reported being involved in the decisions about vascular access, most were satisfied or very satisfied (88%) with their access type. Patient preference centred mainly on avoiding delays in the initiation of chemotherapy. Self-reported rates of complications (183 evaluable responses) were infiltration with peripheral IVs (9/44, 20%), local skin infections with piccs (7/77, 9%), and thrombosis with ports (4/62, 6%). Perceived risk factors for lymphedema included use of the surgical arm for blood draws (117/156, 75%) and blood pressure measurement (115/156, 74%). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients reported being satisfied with the vascular access used for their treatment. Improved education and understanding about the evidence-based requirements for vascular access are needed. Perceived risk factors for lymphedema remain variable and are not evidence-based.

However, a careful review of the literature and a retrospective analysis of the experience at New York Hospital Queens (NYHQ) did not support the position of the Standards. PURPOSE: A prospective, controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted to determine if intravenous vancomycin could be safely administered through a novel midline catheter (POWERWAND®, Access Scientific, San Diego, CA). METHODS: Patients scheduled to receive short-term (<6 days) intravenous vancomycin were randomly assigned to receive treatment through either a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) or the midline study device. Complications and the costs of insertion were recorded. RESULTS: The two groups did not differ significantly with respect to total complications (17.9% with PICCs vs. 19.9% with the midline), phlebitis (0% vs. 0%) or thrombosis (0% vs. 0%). One suspected catheter-associated bloodstream infection did occur in the PICC group. Insertion costs were $90.00 less per insertion in the midline group. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term intravenous vancomycin can be safely and cost-efficiently administered in the deep vessels of the upper arm using the midline study device.

22864473,2013,Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in the management of oncohematological patients submitted to autologous stem cell transplantation. ,"The aim of our study was to evaluate the feasibility and the safety of the use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) during autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Sixty PICCs were inserted in 57 patients (23 females and 34 males; mean age 48, range 19-68 years) and remained in place for an overall period of 1,276 days. All PICCs were positioned by a team of specifically trained physicians and nurses and utilized by specifically trained nurses of our hematology unit. No major insertion-related complications were observed; the only complication during insertion was one local hematoma (1.6 %) due to accidental arterial puncture. Late complications were accidental catheter removal (5 %, 2.3 per 1,000 PICC days), symptomatic catheter-related venous thrombosis (5 %, 2.3 per 1,000 PICC days), and catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI; 3.3 %, 1.5 CRBSI per 1,000 PICC days). The reasons for catheter removal were completion of therapy (42 patients, 70 %), fever of unknown origin (9 patients, 15 %), catheter-related thrombosis (2 patients, 3.3 %), CRBSI (2 patients, 3.3 %), accidental removal (3 patients, 5 %), lumen occlusion (1 patient, 1.6 %), positive culture from peripheral blood (1 patient, 1.6 %), and death (1 patient, 1.6 %).

31387123,2019,Outpatient Parenteral Antibiotic Therapy (OPAT) with Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter in Patients with Periprosthetic Joint Infection. ,"BACKGROUND: A key factor in the successful treatment of periprosthetic joint infection is the consistent antimicrobial therapy. Depending on the pathogen antimicrobial susceptibility, intravenous (i. v.) antibiotics may not be switched to oral medication at patient discharge, without risking a treatment failure. The implementation of an outpatient i. v. therapy using peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) allows for early discharge with continuation of adequate antimicrobial therapy. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the systematic use of PICC in 11 patients with periprosthetic joint infection. Inclusion criterion was the detection of a pathogen that cannot be optimally treated with oral antibiotics according to the current treatment concept (Trampuz et al.). RESULTS: A total of 12 PICCs in 11 patients were analysed. An error or mechanical nerve irritation was not observed. The occurrence of a catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) was not recorded. None of our patients had PICC-associated infections, thrombophlebitis or thrombosis. One patient stopped therapy due to a lack of compliance. Ten patients successfully completed their treatment. At a mean follow-up of 29 months, successful infection eradication as measured by the Delphi criteria was achieved in 100%. CONCLUSION: Although the number of patients included in the study was small, our short-term results suggest a good applicability of PICCs in the outpatient i. v. antimicrobial therapy for treatment of periprosthetic joint infection. Catheter-associated complications could not be observed in our collective. The successful infection control in all cases despite proven difficult-to-treat infection is promising.

27647824,2017,Evaluating safety of tunneled small bore central venous catheters in chronic kidney disease population: A quality improvement initiative. ,"INTRODUCTION: Peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) may adversely impact future successful arteriovenous fistulae (AVF). As part of a quality improvement project, the performance of tunneled small bore tunneled central venous catheters (TSB-CVCs), as alternatives to PICCs, was evaluated. METHODS: A retrospective observational study, involving individuals ≥18 years of age who underwent TSB-CVC placement by Interventional Radiology at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN between 1/1/2010 and 8/30/2013. FINDINGS: The study cohort included 92 patients with a median age of 55 (46-67) years, who underwent 108 TSB-CVC placements. Baseline renal disease was present in 71% (77/108). Most TSB-CVCs were placed in hospitalized patients (94%; 102/108); five French in diameter (61%; 66/108) and located in an internal jugular vein (84%; 91/108). Median catheter indwelling time was 20 (11-43) days (n = 84). TSB-CVC-related bloodstream infection, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and superficial venous thrombosis (SpVT) rates per line were 0.009 (1/108), 0.018 (2/108), and 0.009 (1/108), respectively. Venous outcomes in a subgroup of 54 patients, who had documented PICC placements (n = 161) in addition to TSB-CVC (n = 58) were compared. TSB-CVC-DVT rate was lower than the PICC-DVT rate (0.017 [1/58] vs. 0.106 per line [17/161]; P = 0.04). The TSB-CVC-SpVT rate was not different from the PICC-SpVT rate (0 [0/58] vs. 0.037 [6/161] per line; P = 0.14). DISCUSSION: TSB-CVCs demonstrated an excellent safety profile in our study. These catheters should be preferentially utilized for arm vein preservation in advanced kidney disease. Their impact on future AVF success needs further evaluation.

23917904,2013,The risk of bloodstream infection associated with peripherally inserted central catheters compared with central venous catheters in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are associated with central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). The magnitude of this risk relative to central venous catheters (CVCs) is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To compare risk of CLABSI between PICCs and CVCs. METHODS: MEDLINE, CinAHL, Scopus, EmBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched. Full-text studies comparing the risk of CLABSI between PICCs and CVCs were included. Studies involving adults 18 years of age or older who underwent insertion of a PICC or a CVC and reported CLABSI were included in our analysis. Studies were evaluated using the Downs and Black scale for risk of bias. Random effects meta-analyses were used to generate summary estimates of CLABSI risk in patients with PICCs versus CVCs. RESULTS: Of 1,185 studies identified, 23 studies involving 57,250 patients met eligibility criteria. Twenty of 23 eligible studies reported the total number of CLABSI episodes in patients with PICCs and CVCs. Pooled meta-analyses of these studies revealed that PICCs were associated with a lower risk of CLABSI than were CVCs (relative risk [RR], 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-0.94). Statistical heterogeneity prompted subgroup analysis, which demonstrated that CLABSI reduction was greatest in outpatients (RR [95% CI], 0.22 [0.18-0.27]) compared with hospitalized patients who received PICCs (RR [95% CI], 0.73 [0.54-0.98]). Thirteen of the included 23 studies reported CLABSI per catheter-day. Within these studies, PICC-related CLABSI occurred as frequently as CLABSI from CVCs (incidence rate ratio [95% CI], 0.91 [0.46-1.79]). LIMITATIONS: Only 1 randomized trial met inclusion criteria. CLABSI definition and infection prevention strategies were variably reported. Few studies reported infections by catheter-days. CONCLUSIONS: Although PICCs are associated with a lower risk of CLABSI than CVCs in outpatients, hospitalized patients may be just as likely to experience CLABSI with PICCs as with CVCs. Consideration of risks and benefits before PICC use in inpatient settings is warranted. ",['eng'],"['Comparative Study' 'Journal Article' 'Meta-Analysis' 'Review'

37100824,2023,Safety and feasibility of outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy for patients with spinal infection. ,"Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) is a cost-effective method of administering intravenous antimicrobial therapy. Although OPAT is well established in the UK and US healthcare systems, few centres in Europe perform it. Here we analysed OPAT for the treatment of patients with spinal infections at our institution. In this retrospective study, patients with spinal infection who required intravenous (i.v.) antimicrobial treatment between 2018 and 2021 were analysed. The duration of short-term antimicrobial treatment for skin and soft tissue infections and complex infections requiring long-term antimicrobial treatment, such as spinal bone or joint infections, were analysed. All patients were discharged with a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. Prior to discharge, all patients received training in the safe administration of their medications via the PICC line. The duration of OPAT and the rate of readmission after OPAT were analysed. For this study a total of 52 patients who were treated via OPAT due to spinal infections were analyzed. In 35 cases (69.2%) complex spinal infection was reason for i.v. antimicrobial therapy. Surgery was required in 23 of these 35 patients (65.7%). The average hospital stay for these patients was 12 ± 6 days. The remaining 17 patients were treated for an infection of the soft tissue or the skin and hospital stay for these patients was on average 8 ± 4 days. Gram-positive organisms were isolated in 64.4%. Staphylococcus aureus followed by other Staphylococcus species, was the most common detected organism. After discharging i.v. antimicrobial treatment was given for an average of 20 ± 14 days. The duration of antimicrobial treatment for soft tissue was 10.8 ± 8 days, and for complex infections 25.1 ± 18 days. The mean follow-up was 21 ± 14 months. There was one case of readmission due to treatment failure. There were no difficulties encountered in implementing OPAT. OPAT is a feasible and effective option for delivering intravenous antimicrobial therapy to patients with spinal infections who can be managed without hospitalisation. OPAT offers patient-centred treatment at home while avoiding the risks associated with hospitalisation, with high levels of patient satisfaction.

26269383,2016,Comparison of complications associated with peripherally inserted central catheters and Hickman™ catheters in patients with intestinal failure receiving home parenteral nutrition. Six-year follow up study. ,"BACKGROUND & AIM: Patients with intestinal failure (IF) are dependent on parenteral nutrition delivered through central access such as Hickman™ catheters. The peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) is becoming increasingly popular for the purpose. The aim of the present study was to compare complication rates between the two types of catheters. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over a six-year period (2008-2014), we included 136 patients with IF receiving home parenteral nutrition (HPN). These patients had a total of 295 catheters (169 Hickman™ catheters and 126 PICCs). Data were collected by reviewing their medical records. Incidences are given per 1000 catheter days. Data are given as means ± standard deviation (SD) and compared using independent student's t-tests, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon, and X(2)-tests. A survival analysis for time to the first infection was conducted using Cox regression. RESULTS: The total number of catheter days was 54,912 days for Hickman™ catheters (mean dwell time 325 ± 402) and 15,974 days for PICCs (mean dwell time 127 ± 121), respectively. The incidence of catheter-related blood stream infection (CRBSI) per 1000 catheter days was significantly lower for Hickman™ catheters compared to PICCs (0.56 vs. 1.63, p < 0.05). The mean time to first CRBSI was significantly shorter for PICCs compared to Hickman™ catheters (84 ± 94 days vs. 297 ± 387 days, p < 0.05), which was confirmed with a cox analysis corrected for age and gender. A total of 75 catheters were removed due to CRBSI, 49 Hickman™ catheters and 26 PICCs respectively. In addition, PICCs were more often removed due to local infection/phlebitis and mechanical causes (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We found a higher risk and shorter time to first CRBSI in PICCs compared to Hickman catheters supporting that PICCs should mainly be chosen for planned HPN up to 3-6 months. We therefore conclude that the choice of catheter must still be determined on an individual basis.

31565960,2020,The Safety of Midline Catheters for Intravenous Therapy at a Large Academic Medical Center. ,"Background: Midline catheters (MCs) have arisen as alternatives to peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) for both general intravenous therapy and extended outpatient parenteral therapy. However, there is a lack of data concerning the safety of medication therapy through midline for extended durations. Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of MCs for extended intravenous use. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study evaluating patients who received intravenous therapy through an MC at a tertiary care academic medical center. The primary end point was the incidence of composite catheter-related adverse events that included local events, catheter dislodgment, infiltration, catheter occlusion, catheter-related venous thromboembolism, extravasation, and line-associated infection. Results: A total of 82 MC placements and 50 PICC placements were included; 50 MCs were for outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy, and 32 were for inpatient intravenous use. There were 21 complications per 1000 catheter-days in the outpatient group and 7 complications per 1000 catheter-days in the PICC group (P = 0.91). The median time to complication in both groups was 8 days. The antimicrobial classes commonly associated with complications were cephalosporins, carbapenems, and penicillins. Conclusion and Relevance: Our results suggest that intravenous therapy with MCs is generally safe for prolonged courses that do not exceed 14 days as compared with PICC lines, which can be placed for months. There is still limited evidence for the use of MCs between 14 and 28 days of therapy. This study can help guide our selection of intravenous catheters for the purpose of outpatient antimicrobial therapy.

31464692,2020,Complications and Costs of Peripherally Inserted Central Venous Catheters Compared With Implantable Port Catheters for Cancer Patients: A Meta-analysis. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) and implantable port catheters (IPCs) are 2 most common central venous access for cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. However, no specific evidence exists to guide practitioners on safety and less cost. OBJECTIVE: To compare the differences of complications and costs of PICC and IPC in the treatment of cancer patients with chemotherapy and to provide a basis for better clinical decision making. METHODS: All the cohort studies were searched in the Cochrane Library, JBI, PubMed, Elsevier, Web of Science, CINAHL, CBM, and CNKI from inception to July 2018. Two reviewers screened and selected trials, evaluated quality, and extracted data. Meta-analysis and description of the outcomes were performed by using the RevMan 5.3 software. RESULTS: A total of 761 articles were retrieved, with 15 articles meeting eligibility criteria. Outcome analysis showed no difference in 1-puncture success rate. Peripherally inserted central catheter use was associated with higher complication rates than IPC, including occlusion, infection, malposition, catheter-related thrombosis, extravasation, phlebitis, and accidental removal rate. The life span of IPC was longer than that of PICC, and the costs of IPC were lower. CONCLUSIONS: Implantable port catheter has advantages over PICC in reducing cancer patients' complications and less cost in terms of long-term cancer chemotherapy. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In terms of safety, the results provide evidence for practitioners to choose which type of central venous catheters is better for cancer chemotherapy patients. In terms of costs, practitioners need to make decisions about which type of central venous catheters has less cost. ",['eng'],"['Comparative Study' 'Journal Article' 'Meta-Analysis'

23697825,2013,Risk of venous thromboembolism associated with peripherally inserted central catheters: a systematic review and meta-analysis. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. However, the size of this risk relative to that associated with other central venous catheters (CVCs) is unknown. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the risk of venous thromboembolism associated with PICCs versus that associated with other CVCs. METHODS: We searched several databases, including Medline, Embase, Biosis, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Conference Papers Index, and Scopus. Additional studies were identified through hand searches of bibliographies and internet searches, and we contacted study authors to obtain unpublished data. All human studies published in full text, abstract, or poster form were eligible for inclusion. All studies were of adult patients aged at least 18 years who underwent insertion of a PICC. Studies were assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa risk of bias scale. In studies without a comparison group, the pooled frequency of venous thromboembolism was calculated for patients receiving PICCs. In studies comparing PICCs with other CVCs, summary odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with a random effects meta-analysis. FINDINGS: Of the 533 citations identified, 64 studies (12 with a comparison group and 52 without) including 29 503 patients met the eligibility criteria. In the non-comparison studies, the weighted frequency of PICC-related deep vein thrombosis was highest in patients who were critically ill (13·91%, 95% CI 7·68-20·14) and those with cancer (6·67%, 4·69-8·64). Our meta-analysis of 11 studies comparing the risk of deep vein thrombosis related to PICCs with that related to CVCs showed that PICCs were associated with an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (OR 2·55, 1·54-4·23, p<0·0001) but not pulmonary embolism (no events). With the baseline PICC-related deep vein thrombosis rate of 2·7% and pooled OR of 2·55, the number needed to harm relative to CVCs was 26 (95% CI 13-71). INTERPRETATION: PICCs are associated with a higher risk of deep vein thrombosis than are CVCs, especially in patients who are critically ill or those with a malignancy. The decision to insert PICCs should be guided by weighing of the risk of thrombosis against the benefit provided by these devices. FUNDING: None.

36299679,2022,Functions of Heparin Sodium Injection in the Prevention of Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter-Related Venous Thrombosis in NSCLC Patients during Postoperative Chemotherapy. ,"OBJECTIVE: This study intended to analyze hazardous factors of venous thrombosis by comparing the effect of different doses of heparin sodium injection on the incidence rate of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)-related venous thrombosis in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients during postoperative chemotherapy. METHODS: 425 NSCLC patients who received PICC catheterization in Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Shenzhen Hospital from July 2019 to July 2021 were collected. Based on their different pathological types, patients were given two different chemotherapy regimens: pemetrexed+cisplatin or paclitaxel+cisplatin. Patients were grouped according to the different doses of heparin sodium injection adopted. Control group (n = 140). Catheters were sealed with 10 mL saline only. Group I (n = 142). In addition to routine maintenance with normal saline, 2 mL of 10 IU/mL heparin sodium injection was sealed in the catheters under positive pressure every time after catheterization. Group II (n = 143). In addition to routine maintenance with normal saline, 5 mL of 10 IU/mL heparin sodium injection was sealed in the same manner as Group I. The baseline characteristics of the three groups of patients were compared by statistical means. Doppler ultrasonography was applied to check the venous thrombosis. The hazardous factors of venous thrombosis were analyzed through correlation analysis and binary logistic regression method. RESULTS: The incidence rates of thrombosis in the control group, Group I, and Group II were 20.00%, 7.04%, and 2.09%, respectively, with statistically significant differences (P < 0.01). Additionally, through the collinear correlation analysis of baseline characteristics, a significant correlation between the dosage of heparin sodium injection and the incidence of thrombosis was observed (P < 0.05), but there were no significant differences between other baseline data and the incidence of thrombosis (P > 0.05). Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that postoperative use of heparin sodium injection (Group I: OR = 0.312; P = 0.003; Group II: OR = 0.082, P < 0.001) was a protective factor for preventing thrombosis. In addition, the thromboprophylaxis effect of Group II was better than that of Group I. No serious adverse reactions were found in safety analysis. CONCLUSION: Heparin sodium could significantly lower the incidence rate of PICC-related venous thrombosis in NSCLC patients during postoperative chemotherapy. Heparin sodium injection is safe enough to be promoted among PICC patients with a high risk of venous thrombosis.

29153532,2018,The blind pushing technique for peripherally inserted central catheter placement through brachial vein puncture. ,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct a prospective clinical trial evaluating the technical feasibility and short-term clinical outcome of the blind pushing technique for placement of pretrimmed peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) through brachial vein access. METHODS: Patients requiring PICC placement at any of the three participating institutions were prospectively enrolled between January and December 2016. The review boards of all participating institutions approved this study, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. PICC placement was performed using the blind pushing technique and primary brachial vein access. The following data were collected from unified case report forms: access vein, obstacles during PICC advancement, procedure time, and postprocedural complications. RESULTS: During the 12-month study period, 1380 PICCs were placed in 1043 patients. Of these, 1092 PICCs placed in 837 patients were enrolled, with 834 PICCs (76%) and 258 PICCs (34%) placed through brachial vein and nonbrachial vein access, respectively. In both arms, obstacles were most commonly noted in the subclavian veins (n = 220) and axillary veins (n = 94). Successful puncture of the access vein was achieved at first try in 1028 PICCs (94%). The technical success rate was 99%, with 1055 PICCs (97%) placed within 120 seconds of procedure time and 1088 PICCs (99%) having the tip located at the ideal position. Follow-up Doppler ultrasound detected catheter-associated upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (UEDVT) for 18 PICCs in 16 patients and late symptomatic UEDVT for 16 PICCs in 16 patients (3.1%). Catheter-associated UEDVT was noted for 28 PICCs (82%) and 6 PICCs (18%) placed through brachial vein and nonbrachial vein access, respectively. The incidence of obstacles and the procedure time (<120 seconds) differed significantly between brachial vein and nonbrachial vein access (P = .001). There was no statistically significant difference between brachial vein and nonbrachial vein access in the incidence of UEDVT (odds ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.59-3.52; P = .22). CONCLUSIONS: The placement of pretrimmed PICCs by the blind pushing technique and primary brachial vein access is technically feasible and may represent an alternative to the conventional PICC placement technique, having low incidences of UEDVT and other complications, with no significant difference in outcomes between brachial vein and nonbrachial vein access.

31155160,2019,Implementation of tunneled versus not tunneled peripherally inserted central catheters. ,"Tunneled peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) offer several advantages such as an exit site at the green zone no matter where the puncture point is and a long subcutaneous route, which is considered a shield against infections and provides comfort to the patient. Clinicians could choose the proper exact exit site so as to avoid blood leakage from the exit point. The aim of the study was to assess the value of the tunneled PICCs versus normal PICCs with no long subcutaneous route. Sixty patients were randomly divided into two groups and underwent a PICC placement procedure between August 2014 and November 2014 and were then observed until February 2015. Thirty of them (group A) underwent a PICC placement procedure, after proper ultrasound scan and under local anesthesia, of the veins of the upper limb, internal jugular and axillary veins. The mean (±standard deviation) age of patients was 54.8 ± 9.2 years (range, 18-80 years). The primary success rate was 100% for all patients in both the groups. The procedure was not painful for the patients. In group A, after 3 months of surveillance, 7 devices were removed because the patients' therapy came to an end, and only in one incident, the catheter was removed due to soft tissue infection. Tunneled PICCs seem to be a safe option and an easy alternative to perform in contrast to placement without a tunnel. It is an easy, cheap procedure that allows us to catheterize the vein with a larger caliber and create an exit point at any preselected point on the upper limb.

37146111,2023,Incidence and Predictive Model of Medical Adhesive-Related Skin Injury in Cancer Patients Managed With Central Venous Access Devices: A Retrospective Study. ,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of medical adhesive-related skin injury (MARSI) at the site of central venous access device (CVAD) implantation in patients with cancer, identify risk factors associated with MARSI in patients with cancer, and create a nomogram for predicting risk of MARSI. DESIGN: Retrospective, single-center study. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: The sample comprised 1172 consecutive patients who underwent CVAD implantation between February 2018 and February 2019; their mean age was 55.7 years (SD: 13.9). Data were collected at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, located in Xi'an, China. METHODS: Demographic and pertinent clinical data were collected from patient records. Routine dressing changes were performed every 7 days for peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) or 28 days for ports except in patients with existing skin injuries. Skin injuries related to use of medical adhesives and persisting for more than for 30 minutes were classified MARSI. Data were used to develop a nomogram for predicting MARSI. The accuracy of the nomogram was verified by calculating the concordance index (C-index) and drawing a calibration curve. RESULTS: Among the 1172 patients, 330 (28.2%) had undergone PICC implantation, and 282 (24.1%) experienced 1 or more MARSIs representing an incidence rate of 1.7 events per 1000 CVAD days. Statistical analysis identified previous MARSI history, the need for total parenteral nutrition support, other catheter-related complications, a history of allergy, and PICC implantation as associated with a higher likelihood of developing for MARSI. Based on these factors, we established a nomogram for predicting the risk of developing MARSI in patients with cancer who underwent CVAD implantation. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.96, and the calibration curve of the nomogram showed that the predictive ability of the nomogram was strong. CONCLUSIONS: We evaluated patients with cancer who were undergoing CVAD and identified that previous MARSI history, patients needing total parenteral nutrition support, other catheter-related complications, allergic history, and PICC implantation (compared with ports) were associated with a higher likelihood for developing MARSI. The nomogram we developed showed a good ability for predicting the risk of developing MARSI and may assist nurses to predict MARSI in this population.

","OBJECTIVE: We investigated which arm and vein led to the most successful outcomes during non-fluoroscopic peripherallyinserted central catheter (PICC) insertion. METHODS: A total of 743 cases from July 2012 to March 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. We also analyzed the following: 1) accessed arm (right or left), 2) accessed vein (cephalic, basilic, or brachial), 3) primary and secondary success rates, 4) causes of failure (location of obstacles), and 5) problemsolving methods for catheter repositioning. RESULTS: The primary success rate was 46.3% (344/743) with 49.4% (123/249) on the right arm and 44.7% (273/494) on the left arm. The secondary success rate was 53.7% (399/743) with 50.6% (126/249) on the right arm and 55.3% (273/494) on the left arm. The causes of failure were 100% (43/43) for the left cephalic vein, 61.5% (8/13) for the right cephalic vein, 50.6% (43/85) for the left brachial vein, and 51.1% (23/45) for the right brachial vein, 51.1% (187/366) for the left basilic vein, and 49.7% (95/191) for the right basilic vein. The failure rate through the left cephalic vein was significantly higher than that for other veins. The most common locations of obstacles were the subclavian vein (28.8%, 115/399), axillary vein (24.3%, 97/399), and brachiocephalic vein (19.3%, 77/399). The most common problem-solving methods were with guidewire assistance (74.7%, 298/399), venographic guidance (13.8%, 55/399), and fluoroscopic guidance (11.5%, 46/399). CONCLUSIONS: Right-arm access through the basilic or brachial vein may be more appropriate for successful nonfluoroscopic PICC insertion compared with the access through the left arm and the cephalic vein.

32529962,2021,Comparison of outcomes of central venous catheters in patients with solid and hematologic neoplasms: an Italian real-world analysis. ,"INTRODUCTION: Although many reports have analyzed the outcomes of central venous catheters (CVCs) in oncologic and oncohematologic patients, current guidelines do not routinely recommend a specific type of CVC over the other. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the outcomes of 178 patients with CVCs referred to an Italian specialized cancer center between January 2016 and December 2018. The analysis compares midterm peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) with long-term centrally inserted catheters, including totally implanted ports and tunneled catheters with central insertion (tCVCs). RESULTS: A total of 130 PICCs (73%) and 48 tCVCs (27%) were analyzed. The overall complication rate was significantly increased in the PICC cohort compared to the tCVC cohort (43.1% vs 25%, respectively; p = 0.037), leading to complication-related device removal in 30.8% of PICCs vs 12.5% of tCVCs (p = 0.013). No significant differences in terms of catheter-related thromboses (p = 0.676) or catheter-related infections (p = 0.140) were detected. Nonthrombotic obstructions were significantly higher in the PICC group compared to the tCVC cohort (p = 0.006). Overall complication-free survival was significantly longer for tCVCs compared to PICCs (hazard ratio [HR], 0.262; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.128-0.536; p < 0.0001), as well as obstruction-free survival (HR, 0.082; 95% CI, 0.018-0.372; p < 0.0001). In multivariable analysis, the type of CVC was independently correlated with the occurrence of any complication (HR, 0.273; 95% CI, 0.135-0.553; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This Italian real-world experience suggests that PICCs are associated with a higher risk of overall complications compared with tCVCs. Catheter choice in oncologic patients should be guided by treatment type and duration, risk-benefit assessment, patient preferences, and compliance.

24436591,2013,Risk of Venous Thromboembolism in Patients Infected with HIV: A Cohort Study. ,"Introduction Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients are at risk of developing thrombosis than general population. There are several intersecting mechanisms associated with HIV infection and antiviral therapy that are emerging, which may lead to vasculopathy and hypercoagulability in these patients. Methods We analyzed the HIV patients who followed up with our Vascular Medicine outpatient clinic with venous thromboembolism (VTE) over the past 3 years and followed them prospectively. The patients included were those who had minimum, regular follow-up of 3 months, with a Doppler scan in the beginning and last follow-up. Patients were analyzed for age, gender, race, site of thrombosis, coagulation factors, lipid panel, type of antiretroviral treatment, past or present history of infections or malignancy, CD4 absolute and helper cell counts at the beginning of thrombosis, response to treatment and outcome. Patients with HIV with arterial thrombosis were excluded. Results A total of eight patients were analyzed. The mean age was 49.87 years (range, 38-58 years). All were male patients with six patients having lower limb thrombosis, one patient with upper limb thrombosis related to peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC), and one patient had pulmonary embolism with no deep vein thrombosis. Most common venous thrombosis was popliteal vein thrombosis, followed by common femoral, superficial femoral and external iliac thrombosis. Two patients had deficiency of protein S, two had high homocysteine levels, one had deficiency of antithrombin 3, and one had increase in anticardiolipin Immunoglobulin antibody. All patients were taking nucleoside and nonnucleoside inhibitors but only two patients were taking protease inhibitors. There was history of lymphoma in one and nonsmall cell lung carcinoma in one patient. Three patients had past history of tuberculosis and one of these patients also had pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. The mean absolute CD4 counts were 383.25 cells/UL (range, 103-908 cells/UL) and helper CD4 counts were 22.5 cells/UL (range, 12-45 cells/UL). All were anticoagulated with warfarin or enoxaparin. There was complete resolution of deep vein thrombosis in two patients (one with PICC line thrombosis in 3 months and other with popliteal vein thrombosis in 1 year). There was extension of clot in one patient and no resolution in others. Seven patients are still alive and on regular follow-up. Conclusion Thrombosis in HIV patients is seen more commonly in middle aged, community ambulant male patients. Left lower limb involvement with involvement of popliteal vein is most common. Deficiency of protein S and hyperhomocystenaemia were noted in these patients. Most of these patients did not respond to therapeutic anticoagulation, but the extension of the thrombosis was prevented in majority of cases.

35815563,2023,Central venous catheters-related-thrombosis and risk factors in oncological patients: A retrospective evaluation of recent risk scores. ,"BACKGROUND: Insertions of central venous catheters (CVC) has become a common practice in Onco-Hematologic Units to administer systemic treatments. Unfortunately they can cause complications influencing patient's care-pathway significantly. Oncological patients have a higher thrombotic risk than the general population, therefore specific recent risk scores are spreading through the clinical practice, such as Khorana, Protecht, COMPASS-CAT, and Michigan scores. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 177 out of a total of 3046 outpatients accessing the Medical Day Hospital of Istituto Nazionale Tumori di Milano from March 2019 to February 2021 aged ⩾ 18 years who developed CVC complications was analyzed extracting clinical data from their medical records. Focusing on the risk factors, especially through recent risk scores to estimate the thrombotic risk we used Wilcoxon-test for continuous variables and the Pearson-Chi-Square test for categorical variables. RESULTS: Anticoagulants resulted a protective factor mostly for partial CVC occlusion (p = 0.0001), preventing CVC occlusions. CVC occlusions were significantly associated with epitelial tumor histotype, (p = 0.0061). Complete CVC occlusions were significantly associated with peripherical inserted central venous catheters (PICC) (p < 0.0001). Catheter-related-thrombosis (CRT) was significantly associated with peripherical-inserted-central-venous-catheter, both when it was diagnosed clinically (p = 0.0121) and radiographically (p = 0.0168).There was a strong association between CRT and a high grade of Khorana Score (p = 0.0195), Protecht Score (p = 0.0412), COMPASS-CAT Score (p = 0.0027). A positive statistical trend was observed between the Michigan Score and CRT in patients carrying PICC (p = 0.053). CONCLUSIONS: There are many different and various factors associated with higher or lower risk of CVC thrombotic complications, so it could be useful to test the recent risk scores to estimate thrombotic risk in oncological patients in clinical practice.

35701467,2022,A clinical study of peripherally inserted central catheter-related venous thromboembolism in patients with hematological malignancies. ,"This study aimed to explore the risk factors of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)-related venous thromboembolism (CRT) in patients with hematological malignancies and the predictive ability of the thrombotic risk assessment models (RAMs). The clinical data of the 117 eligible patients with hematological neoplasms at Mianyang Central Hospital with PICC from May 2018 to May 2020 were analyzed in this retrospective study. Thrombosis risk scores were calculated in patients with image-confirmed PICC-related thromboembolism. CRT occurred in 19 cases. Compared to the CRT-free group, the CRT group was older and showed higher body mass index (BMI), leukocyte count level, and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that BMI (P = 0.03) was a significant risk factor for CRT. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the Caprini scale (P = 0.01) was higher than that of the modified Wells scale (P = 0.94), the revised Geneva scale (P = 0.83), Padua scale (P = 0.59), and Michigan scale (P = 0.80). The sensitivity and specificity for the Caprini scale, Padua scale, modified Wells scale, the revised Geneva scale, and Michigan risk score were 63.3%/73.7%, 100%/0.00%, 95.9%/5.3%, 31.6%/73.7%, and 1.0%/99.0%, respectively. Caprini RAM had a better predictive ability for CRT in patients with hematological malignancies. Michigan risk score may not be better than Caprini RAM in this population.

33989915,2021,Extended dwell and standard ultrasound guided peripheral intravenous catheters: Comparison of durability and reliability. ,"Background Vascular access is a critical component of emergency department (ED) care. Ultrasound guided placement of peripheral intravenous (USIV) catheters is increasingly common. However, USIV are thought to suffer from reduced durability and higher complication rates. Extended dwell catheters (EDC) are long peripheral IVs placed under combined ultrasound and wire guidance. The goal of this study is to compare dwell times and complication rates of EDC to standard peripheral USIV. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study at a tertiary care adult ED comparing IV placements during a 17-month period (8/1/2018-12/31/2019), stratified by standard USIV versus EDC. The primary outcome was catheter dwell time and secondary outcomes included need for inpatient vascular access team (VAST) consultation, peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) insertions, and radiocontrast extravasations. Multivariable Cox regression time-to-event analyses were used to evaluate dwell times, adjusting for age, gender, BMI and end-stage renal disease. Results 359 EDC and 4190 standard USIV were included for analysis. Most USIV (95.6%) and EDC (98.3%) were placed by ED technicians trained in ultrasound vascular access. EDC median dwell time (5.9 days [95%CI: 5.1-6.7]) exceeded standard USIV (3.8 days [95% CI: 3.6-4.0]). Patients with EDC placed in the ED required less VAST consultation (0.84 vs 0.99 charges/encounter), had similar rates of PICC line use (8.0% vs 8.4% of encounters) and had no radiocontrast extravasation events. Multivariable Cox regression demonstrated survival benefit (longer dwell time) favoring EDC (HR 0.70 [95%CI 0.60-0.81]). Conclusion Use of EDC results in longer dwell time and reduces subsequent use of vascular access resources, while maintaining low complication rates. EDC demonstrate superior durability which may justify their selection over standard USIV in some patients. ",['eng'],['Comparative Study' 'Journal Article'],"['Adult' 'Aged'

It is almost always associated with pulmonary thromboembolism and is a medical emergency with reported mortality rates of over 40%. We present two cases of right heart thrombus in transit with pulmonary thromboembolism resulting from venous thrombosis associated with peripherally inserted central catheters that were managed with different approaches. The cases highlight that clinicians should have a low threshold to utilise imaging modalities such as computerised tomography and transthoracic echocardiography when there is an untoward change in physiological parameters among patients with peripherally inserted central catheters, particularly those with risk factors for peripherally inserted central catheter associated venous thrombosis. Furthermore, procedural optimisation surrounding peripherally inserted central catheters, such as insertion technique and choice of lumen size, is underscored.

32770871,2020,Central venous catheter insertion and maintenance: Evidence-based clinical recommendations. ,"OBJECTIVE: To share with clinicians supporting evidence of the safest and the most effective processes for central venous catheter insertion and maintenance as a strategy to prevent catheter-associated bloodstream infections. METHODS: A literature search was conducted in the Medline via PubMed, Embase Central and Lilacs databases based on a set of clinical questions aimed at improving safety and effectiveness at key moments in the process of central venous catheter insertion and maintenance. The rapid literature review methodology was used. The studies identified were assessed from the quality point of view, using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tools for qualitative and quantitative studies and for systematic reviews. Clinical practice guidelines were assessed using the AGREE II tool. The evidence is presented in the form of evidence-based clinical recommendations, which were graded in accordance with the JBI methodology. RESULTS: Twelve clinical evidence summaries containing evidence related to the safe and effective use of central venous catheters are presented, including the following topics: central venous catheter insertion (CVC), peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC), preoperative assessment, the use of analgesia, field preparation, choice between CVC or PICC, CVC care and maintenance, prevention of complications, and general considerations pertaining to the use of central venous catheters in oncologic patients and in parenteral nutrition. CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations on the safe and effective use of central venous access catheters in relation to CVC insertion and maintenance processes are presented in the evidence-based summary model. It is necessary to evaluate their implementation in health outcomes in the institutions where they are developed.

29148000,2018,The feasibility and safety of PICCs accessed via the superficial femoral vein in patients with superior vena cava syndrome. ,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility and safety of the peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) accessed via the superficial femoral vein in patients with superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS). METHODS: From October 2010 to December 2014, 221 cancer patients with SVCS in our center received real-time ultrasound-guidance of the superficial femoral vein inserted central catheters (FICCs) at the mid-thigh. PICC insertion via upper extremity veins had also been investigated in 2604 cancer patients without SVCS as control. The average catheterization time, one-time puncture frequency, catheter duration and complications were compared between two groups. RESULTS: In the FICC group, the mean catheterization time was 31.60 ± 0.15 minutes, one-time puncture frequency was 1.05 ± 0.08, and catheter duration was 168.95 ± 20.47 days. There was no significant difference compared with the upper extremity veins PICC group: 31.11 ± 3.86 minutes, 1.03 ± 0.30, and 173.58 ± 39.81 days, respectively. The major complications included skin allergy to chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) dressings, exudation, catheter-related infection, catheter occlusions, unplanned catheter withdrawal, venous thrombosis, mechanical phlebitis, and catheter malposition. It is interesting that a higher rate of catheter malposition was observed in the upper extremity veins PICC group than in the FICC group (2.15% vs. 0.00%). There were no significant differences in other complications between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time ultrasound-guided PICCs accessed via the superficial femoral vein at the mid-thigh is a new modified technique with low complications, which can be a feasible and safe alternative venous access for patients with SVCS.

28676535,2017,Outcomes in a nurse-led peripherally inserted central catheter program: a retrospective cohort study. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) provide enormous benefit to patients. However, recent publications have highlighted relatively high PICC-associated complication rates. We report on patient and device outcomes from a nurse-led program. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort of consecutive patients undergoing PICC insertion at The Ottawa Hospital between Jan. 1, 2013 and Dec. 31, 2014. Of the 8314 BioFlo PASV PICCs inserted, we randomly selected a sample of 700 and obtained a complete data set for 656. We measured the cumulative incidence of major complications (catheter-related bloodstream infections and deep vein thrombosis) and use of a thrombolytic to alleviate occlusions. RESULTS: The total number of catheter days was 58 486, and the median dwell time 45 days. We observed 4 cases of catheter-related bloodstream infection (0.6% [95% CI 0.17%-1.55%]) (0.07/1000 catheter days). Ten patients (1.5% [95% CI 0.83%-2.78%]) (0.17/1000 catheter days) had catheter-related deep venous thrombosis. At least 1 dose of thrombolytic was required in 75 catheters (11.4% [95% CI 8.61%-13.39]), 31 (7.1%) of the 436 single-lumen catheters and 113 (25.7%) of the 440 lumina of dual-lumen catheters (p < 0.001). INTERPRETATION: We attribute our low rates of major complications to a nurse-led expert insertion team, standardized care and maintenance protocols, high insertion volumes, novel catheter material and continuous quality-improvement initiatives that are implemented and evaluated regularly. We conclude that the considerable benefits PICCs provide to patients are attained with a low risk of major complications. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],[],[]
29377971,2018,Patterns and Predictors of Short-Term Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter Use: A Multicenter Prospective Cohort Study. ,"BACKGROUND: The guidelines for peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) recommend avoiding insertion if the anticipated duration of use is =5 days. However, short-term PICC use is common in hospitals. We sought to identify patient, provider, and device characteristics and the clinical outcomes associated with short-term PICCs. METHODS: Between January 2014 and June 2016, trained abstractors at 52 Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety (HMS) Consortium sites collected data from medical records of adults that received PICCs during hospitalization. Patients were prospectively followed until PICC removal, death, or 70 days after insertion. Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to identify factors associated with short-term PICCs, defined as dwell time of =5 days. Complications associated with short-term use, including major (eg, venous thromboembolism [VTE] or central lineassociated bloodstream infection [CLABSI]) or minor (eg, catheter occlusion, tip migration) events were assessed. RESULTS: Of the 15,397 PICCs placed, 3902 (25.3%) had a dwell time of =5 days. Most (95.5%) short-term PICCs were removed during hospitalization. Compared to PICCs placed for >5 days, variables associated with short-term PICCs included difficult venous access (odds ratio [OR], 1.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.40-1.69), multilumen devices (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.39-1.69), and teaching hospitals (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.04-1.52). Among those with short-term PICCs, 374 (9.6%) experienced a complication, including 99 (2.5%) experiencing VTE and 17 (0.4%) experiencing CLABSI events. The most common minor complications were catheter occlusion (4%) and tip migration (2.2%). CONCLUSION: Short-term use of PICCs is common and associated with patient, provider, and device factors. As PICC placement, even for brief periods, is associated with complications, efforts targeted at factors underlying such use appear necessary.

35108580,2022,Peripherally inserted central catheter-related bloodstream infections in patients with hematological malignancies: A retrospective 7-years single-center study. ,"OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate the nature and incidence of bloodstream infection complications and to identify the risk factors of central catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI). METHODS: During the study period, 291 consecutive patients with hematological malignancies who underwent PICC placement were retrospectively enrolled. We analyzed the covariates that were specified a priori for their association with CRBSI through multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models. The association between each predictor and the related outcome was expressed using hazard ratios (HRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Of 391 peripherally inserted central catheter (PICCs) were inserted in 291 patients for a total of 63,714 catheter days during 7 years, with an infection rate of 0.71/1,000 catheter days. Among the patients with hematological malignancies, those with acute leukemia were prone to CRBSI. Having previous bloodstream infection (BSI) (HR 18.139; 95% CI, 8.19-40.174; P < .0001), the number of PICCs insertions (HR 4.695; 95% CI, 1.842-11.967; P = .001) (twice), (HR 6.794; 95% CI, 1.909-24.181; P = .003) (≥3 times) were significantly associated with CRBSI. Not accompanied by chronic comorbidities (HR 0.34; 95% CI, 0.131-0.887; P = .028) and longer duration of PICC use (days) (HR 0.997; 95% CI, 0.994-0.999; P = .008) might be protective factors preventing CRBSI. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding suggests that previous BSI and a higher number of PICC insertions are associated with an increased risk of CRBSI. A lack of chronic comorbidities may help prevent CRBSI.

The purpose of this study was to assess the safety of the sinus tarsi approach in regard to the incidence of deep infection and amputation following open reduction and internal fixation intra-articular calcaneal fractures. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients with displaced intra-articular calcaneus fractures treated with internal fixation through the sinus tarsi approach in a five year period. All surgeries were performed in a single level one trauma center by a single orthopedic trauma fellowship trained surgeon. RESULTS: Seventeen patients with an average age of 36.6 ± 13.6 years (range 12-61 years) met the inclusion criteria. The time between injury and surgery was on average 6.1 days (range 1-22 days). Average follow up was 116 ± 78.2 days (range 3-276 days). Two patients (11.7%) had diabetes mellitus. None of the patients required amputation. Three patients (17.6%) developed deep infection and underwent subsequent formal irrigation and debridement, two of these requiring multiple repeat surgeries in addition to hardware removals. Negative pressure wound therapy and long term antibiotics via peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) were necessary in these three patients with wound infections. CONCLUSION: The sinus tarsi approach for intra fixation intra-articular calcaneal fractures is safe as compared to the traditional extensile approach in regard to flap necrosis and amputation. However, the rate of deep infection was higher than previously described in the literature. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],[],"['Sinus tarsi' 'calcaneus fracture' 'complication' 'deep infection'

31324486,2019,What do patients say about their experience with urinary catheters and peripherally inserted central catheters? ,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the patient experience with urinary catheters or peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs). We sought to better understand patient perspectives on having a urinary catheter or a PICC by reviewing open-ended comments made by patients about having either of these 2 devices. METHODS: As part of a larger study, we asked patients about certain catheter-related complications at the time of catheter placement and on days 14, 30, and 70 (PICCs only). In this larger project, we performed a structured assessment that included an open-ended question about other comments (initial interview) or problems (follow-up interview) associated with the device. For the current study, we conducted a descriptive analysis of these open-ended comments, classifying them as positive, negative, or neutral. RESULTS: Positive comments about urinary catheters accounted for 9 of 147 comments (6%), whereas positive comments about PICCs accounted for 10 of 100 comments (10%). Positive comments for both catheter types were mostly related to convenience. More than 80% of comments about both types of devices were negative and fell into the following areas: catheter malfunction; pain, irritation, or discomfort; interference with activities of daily living; provider error; and other. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the need to optimize the patient experience with placement, ongoing use, and removal of urinary catheters and PICCs.

30367991,2018,The Integrating Pharmacogenetics in Clinical Care (I-PICC) Study: Protocol for a point-of-care randomized controlled trial of statin pharmacogenetics in primary care. ,"BACKGROUND: The association between the SLCO1B1 rs4149056 variant and statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) is well validated, but the clinical utility of its implementation in patient care is unknown. DESIGN: The Integrating Pharmacogenetics in Clinical Care (I-PICC) Study is a pseudo-cluster randomized controlled trial of SLCO1B1 genotyping among statin-naïve primary care and women's health patients across the Veteran Affairs Boston Healthcare System. Eligible patients of enrolled primary care providers are aged 40-75 and have elevated risk of cardiovascular disease by American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines. Patients give consent by telephone in advance of an upcoming appointment, but they are enrolled only if and when their provider co-signs an order for SLCO1B1 testing, performed on a blood sample already collected in clinical care. Enrolled patients are randomly allocated to have their providers receive results through the electronic health record at baseline (PGx + arm) versus after 12 months (PGx- arm). The primary outcome is the change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) after one year. Secondary outcomes are concordance with Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines for simvastatin prescribing, concordance with ACC/AHA guidelines for statin use, and incidence of SAMS. With 408 patients, the study has >80% power to exclude a between-group LDL-C difference of 10 mg/dL (non-inferiority design) and to detect between-group differences of 15% in CPIC guideline concordance (superiority design).

36767070,2023,Complications Associated with Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters (PICC) in People Undergoing Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) in Home Hospitalization. ,"INTRODUCTION: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic generated the need to keep immunosuppressed patients away from hospital institutions for as long as possible. This in turn stimulated the implementation of a home hospitalization model for autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). PURPOSE: To analyze whether there are significant differences in post-transplantation complications related to catheters observed in patients treated in the home-transplant care modality compared to patients treated in the hospital. METHODOLOGY: Observational, analytical, longitudinal, and retrospective study of cases and controls. A convenience sample was chosen, in which the cases comprised 20 patients included in the home HSCT care model. For each patient, it was considered suitable to propose two controls among those who received autologous transplantation in the last five years with a baseline demographic and pathological profile similar to the case for whom they were control. RESULTS: The home patients achieved an average of 22.4 ± 2.6 days of evolution with an average of 16.4 ± 2.08 days post-transplant, compared to the hospital process with an average of 21.21 ± 4.18 days of evolution and 15.51 ± 3.96 days post-transplant (evolution days p = 0.022; post-transplant days p = 0.002). A higher percentage of use of parenteral nutrition (p = 0.036) and transfusions (p = 0.003) was observed during the post-transplant phase in the hospital. The rest of the therapeutic measures did not show significant differences. When analyzing the frequency of adverse effects in the post-transplant phase, a significant increase in neutropenic fever (OR = 8.55) and positive blood cultures (OR = 6.65) was observed in hospital patients. Any other significant differences in other variables related to PICC were found (presence and days of neutropenic fever, catheter infection, complications, pathogens, admission to the ICU, or death). Concerning local complications (pain, DVT, Medical adhesive-related Skin Injury, and erythema), there was more erythema in the hospital (p = 0.056). CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained indicate that regarding the appearance of complications associated with PICCs in home hospitalization HSCT patients, there are no significant differences compared to hospitalization, so that home care can be a safe context for people with these lines.

25120012,2015,Peripherally inserted central catheters in non-hospitalized cancer patients: 5-year results of a prospective study. ,"PURPOSE: Few prospective follow-up studies evaluating the use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) to deliver chemotherapy and/or home parenteral nutrition (HPN) have focused exclusively on oncology outpatients. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the reliability and the safety of PICCs over a 5-year use in non-hospitalized cancer patients requiring long-term intravenous therapies. METHODS: Since June 2008, all adult oncology outpatient candidates for PICC insertion were consecutively enrolled and the incidence of catheter-related complications was investigated. The follow-up continued until the PICC removal. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-nine PICCs in 250 patients (98 % with solid malignancies) were studied, for a total of 55,293 catheter days (median dwell time 184 days, range 15-1,384). All patients received HPN and 71 % received chemotherapy during the study period. The incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) was low (0.05 per 1,000 catheter days), PICC-related symptomatic thrombosis was rare (1.1 %; 0.05 per 1,000 catheter days), and mechanical complications were uncommon (13.1 %; 0.63 per 1,000 catheter days). The overall complication rate was 17.5 % (0.85 per 1,000 catheter days) and PICCs were removed because of complications only in 7 % of cases. The main findings of this study were that, if accurately managed, PICCs can be safely used in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and/or HPN, recording a low incidence of CRBSI, thrombosis, and mechanical complications; a long catheter life span; and a low probability of catheter removal because of complications. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that PICCs can be successfully utilized as safe and long-lasting venous access devices in non-hospitalized cancer patients.

25891668,2015,"Quality of Life, Pain Perception, and Distress Correlated to Ultrasound-Guided Peripherally Inserted Central Venous Catheters in Palliative Care Patients in a Home or Hospice Setting. ","CONTEXT: Intravenous fluid administration with peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) and midline catheters in palliative care. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate distress and pain perceived by patients during the positioning of a PICC or midline catheter, both in the home and hospice settings. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study performed by the Palliative Care Network of Pordenone. In addition to evaluating distress and pain, we monitored patient quality of life and the devices used. Quality of life was measured with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Core 15-Palliative scale. RESULTS: From May 2012 to July 2013, 48 patients were enrolled in the study. The level of distress during the procedure was null or very low in 95.8% of the patients and completely absent after one week. Pain during insertion was null or very little in 93.8% of the patients and zero after one week in 98% of the patients. Quality of life was significantly improved after one week for certain specific parameters and also globally. The number of catheter days monitored was 3097. The weekly monitoring of the devices revealed a series of minor complications. Only two catheters were removed for serious complications. CONCLUSION: Our results showed a low impact on pain and distress, a low level of local and systemic complications and a favorable impact on patients' quality of life. However, other studies are necessary to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the use of these devices and their role in palliative care. ",['eng'],"['Journal Article' 'Observational Study'

37283643,2023,Dalbavancin in catheter-related bloodstream infections: a pilot study. ,"BACKGROUND: Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) represent a frequent complication of vascular catheterization, with high morbidity, mortality, and associated costs. Most infections are caused by Gram-positive bacteria; thus dalbavancin, a new long-acting lipoglicopeptide, may have a role in early patient discharge strategies optimizing treatment and reducing overall costs. METHODS: In this small pilot feasibility study, we assessed the efficacy and safety of a ""single step"" treatment strategy combining dalbavancin administration (1500 mg IV single dose), catheter removal, and early discharge in adult patients admitted to medical wards in a three-year period. RESULTS: We enrolled sixteen patients with confirmed Gram-positive CRBSI, with a mean age of 68 years and relevant comorbidities (median Charlson Comorbidity index=7). The most frequent causative agents were staphylococci, with 25% of methicillin-resistant strains, and the majority of infected devices were short term central venous catheter (CVC) and peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC). Ten out of sixteen patients had been treated empirically before dalbavancin administration. The mean time from dalbavancin administration to discharge was 2 days; none of the patients had adverse drug-related reactions; at 30- and 90-day follow-up, no patients have been readmitted to the hospital due to bacteraemia recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that single-dose dalbavancin is highly effective, well-tolerated, and cost-saving for Gram-positive CRBSI.

We retrospectively evaluated the vascular access procedures for intravenous chemotherapy in breast cancer patients from 2016 to 2018. A total of 300 consecutive patients were included, 100 each who received peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), arm ports, and chest ports. When selecting a catheter, a PICC was considered when four cycles of chemotherapy were expected. Otherwise, patient preference was considered. All but one patient with an arm port were women, with mean age of 51.7 ± 9.1 years. The total mean complication-free catheter indwelling time was 1357.6 days for chest ports, 997.8 days for arm ports, and 366.8 days for PICCs (p = 0.004). There were 11 catheter-related complications (3.7%), one in a chest port patient, five in arm port patients, and eight in PICC patients. There was no patient with catheter related blood stream infection or deep vein thrombosis. All three types of catheters could be used in breast cancer patients without causing serious complications. The selection of catheter considering the clinical situation was effective for providing a safe and secure chemotherapy delivery route.

34842905,2022,Safety and Outcomes of Midline Catheters vs Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters for Patients With Short-term Indications: A Multicenter Study. ,"IMPORTANCE: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) and midlines are frequently used for short-term venous access; whether one is safer than the other in this setting has not been adequately reported. OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes between patients who had a PICC vs midline placed for the indication of difficult vascular access or antibiotic therapy for 30 or fewer days. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study analyzed data from a multihospital registry including patients admitted to a participating site from December 2017 through January 2020 who had a PICC or midline placement for the indications of difficult venous access or intravenous antibiotic therapy prescribed for 30 or fewer days. Data were analyzed from October 2020 to March 2021. EXPOSURES: PICC and midline placement. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Major complications, including a composite of symptomatic catheter-associated deep vein thrombosis (DVT), catheter-related bloodstream infection, and catheter occlusion. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression models (taking into account catheter dwell) were used to estimate risk for major complications, adjusting for patient and device characteristics and the clustered nature of the data. Sensitivity analyses limiting analyses to 10 days of device dwell were performed. RESULTS: Data on 10 863 patients, 5758 with PICCs and 5105 with midlines (median [IQR] age of device recipients, 64.8 [53.4-75.4] years; 5741 [52.8%] were female), were included. After adjusting for patient characteristics, comorbidities, catheter lumens, and dwell time in logit models, patients who received PICCs had a greater risk of developing a major complication compared with those who received midlines (odds ratio, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.61-2.47). Reduction in complications stemmed from lower rates of occlusion (2.1% vs 7.0%; P < .001) and bloodstream infection (0.4% vs 1.6%; P < .001) in midlines vs PICCs; no significant difference in the risk of DVT between PICCs and midlines was observed. In time-to-event models, similar outcomes for bloodstream infection and catheter occlusion were noted; however, the risk of DVT events was lower in patients who received PICCs vs midlines (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38-0.74). Results were robust to sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study among patients with placement of midline catheters vs PICCs for short-term indications, midlines were associated with a lower risk of bloodstream infection and occlusion compared with PICCs. Whether DVT risk is similar or greater with midlines compared with PICCs for short-term use is unclear. Randomized clinical trials comparing these devices for this indication are needed.

33560493,2022,Bedside ultrasound as a screening test for the diagnosis of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBI). ,"PURPOSE: Between 15 and 30% of all nosocomial bacteremias and sepsis are associated with the use of intravascular devices. Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBI) are infections in which the organism identified in the blood is also present on the tip of the catheter itself or in a blood sample taken through it. The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of ultrasound in the diagnosis of infections related to the use of central catheters. METHODS: Between January 2018 and June 2019, we carried out a prospective study on 36 patients with a central catheter, such as a central venous catheter (CVC), a central catheter with peripheral insertion (PICC), or a fully implanted central venous catheter (PORT-a-cath) and who had signs and symptoms of infection. These patients were submitted to an ultrasound of the catheter upon arrival in the ward in case of suspected infection, or at the time of the onset of signs and symptoms of infection (if these arose during hospitalization). Patients with a central catheter but without signs and symptoms of infection were not included in the study. The end point of the study was to evaluate sensitivity (SENS), specificity (SPEC), positive and negative predictive value (PPV-NPV) and overall diagnostic accuracy (ODA) of ultrasound in the diagnosis of CRBI through Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: US showed a SENS of 94%, a SPEC of 84%, a PPV of 84%, an NPV of 94% and an ODA of 88.8% for the diagnosis of CRBI. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary data from our study show that US of intravascular devices has a high SENS and SPEC in the diagnosis of CRBI, and can, therefore, be used as a valid tool to decide whether to remove the device early or leave it in place.

METHODS: From January 1, 2014 to February 10, 2022, we conducted a multinational multicenter prospective cohort study in 58 ICUs of 34 hospitals in 21 cities in 8 Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama). We applied multiple-logistic regression. Outcomes are shown as adjusted-odds ratios (aOR). RESULTS: About 29,385 patients were hospitalized during 92,956 days, acquired 400 CLABSIs, and pooled CLABSI rate was 4.30 CLABSIs per 1,000 CL-days. We analyzed following 10 variables: Gender, age, length of stay (LOS) before CLABSI acquisition, CL-days before CLABSI acquisition, CL-device utilization (DU) ratio, CL-type, tracheostomy use, hospitalization type, intensive care unit (ICU) type, and facility ownership, Following variables were independently associated with CLABSI: LOS before CLABSI acquisition, rising risk 3% daily (aOR=1.03;95%CI=1.02-1.04; P < .0001); number of CL-days before CLABSI acquisition, rising risk 4% per CL-day (aOR=1.04;95%CI=1.03-1.05; P < .0001); publicly-owned facility (aOR=2.33;95%CI=1.79-3.02; P < .0001). ICU with highest risk was medical-surgical (aOR=2.61;95%CI=1.41-4.81; P < .0001). CL with the highest risk were femoral (aOR=2.71;95%CI=1.61-4.55; P < .0001), and internal-jugular (aOR=2.62;95%CI=1.82-3.79; P < .0001). PICC (aOR=1.25;95%CI=0.63-2.51; P = .52) was not associated with CLABSI risk. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings it is suggested to focus on reducing LOS, CL-days, using PICC instead of femoral or internal-jugular; and implementing evidence-based CLABSI prevention recommendations.

We compare complication rates of PORTs and PICCs in cancer treatment in a retrospective study of 3365 patients with both solid organ (n = 2612) and hematologic (n = 753) malignancies, between 2001 and 2021. 26.4% (n = 890) of all patients were treated via PICCs and 73.6% (2475) via PORTs. 20.7% (578) experienced a major catheter-related complication with a higher rate in PICCs than in PORTs (23.5% vs 14.9%, P < .001). Among major complications, infections and mechanical complications were more common in PICCs than in PORTs (11.9% vs 6.4%, P = .001, 7.3% vs 4.2%, P = .002), whereas the rate of thrombosis was similar (3.4% vs 3.0%, P = .9). While PORTs had a higher rate of periprocedural complications (2.7% vs 1.1%, P < .05), PICCs overall complication rate exceeded PORTs within 3 days from implantation. Median follow-up was 49 (PICC) and 60 weeks (PORT). PORTs are safer and therefore should be preferred in this setting regardless of catheter dwell time.

The diagnosis of cardiac tamponade was not detected in hospital during the intrapericardial infusion of total parenteral nutrition and was only registered during the autopsy. The postmortem examination showed a milky liquid inside the pericardial cavity compatible with the total parenteral nutrition administered. The catheter in its migration in the cardiac chambers, mechanically perforated the inner wall of the endocardium between the trabeculae carneae, continued its course between the myocardial fibers until it was externalized. In conclusion, cardiac tamponade, although it is an extremely rare medical complication, has a high risk of fatality specially if peripheral rather than central veins were cannulated.

Central venous catheter-related thrombosis (CVCT) is a major complication that can cause significant morbidity and mortality. We sought to explore the rate of CVCT in a general cancer population in Australia and to identify factors associated with increased risk of thrombosis. DESIGN: This is a multi-centre retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We analysed key patient, treatment, and cancer-related factors for 317 patients with cancer and central venous catheters inserted for systemic therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Symptomatic CVCT confirmed with imaging and management of patients with CVCT. RESULTS: A total of 402 cases of central line insertion were analysed. Central venous catheter-related thrombosis occurred in 24 patients (6.0%). Having a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC; HR = 3.78, 95% CI = 1.28-11.19, P = .02) compared with an implantable port and a body mass index of ⩾25.0 kg/m(2) (HR = 3.60, 95% CI = 1.31-9.85, P = .01) were independently associated with increased risk of thrombosis. Central venous catheter-related thrombosis was managed mostly with removal of the catheter (19 of 24 cases) and anticoagulation, including direct-acting oral anticoagulants in 5 patients.

According to the diagnostic criteria of venous thromboembolism, high-risk patients with venous thrombosis within 13 days after catheterization were enrolled in the observation group, and those without thromboembolism were enrolled in the control group. Venous blood was taken from all patients on days 1, 5, 9, and 13 after catheterization to measure the change trend of coagulation indexes of patients and to compare the difference of coagulation indexes between the observation group and the control group. RESULTS: PT values of all patients were within the normal reference range at days 1, 5, 9, and 13 after catheterization. Compared with the control group, the observation group was significantly reduced on days 5, 9, and 13 after catheterization (P < 0.05), and continued to decrease with the prolonging of time(P < 0.05). After catheterization, the values of all patients at each time point were lower than the normal reference range. Compared with the control group, the values of tumor patients in the observation group were significantly decreased on days 5, 9, and 13 (P < 0.05) and continued to decrease at each time point (P < 0.05). DD values in the observation group were all higher than the normal reference range on days 1, 5, 9, and 13 after catheterization. Compared with the control group, DD values in the observation group were significantly higher on days 1, 5, 9, and 13 after catheterization (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: PT and APTT continued to decrease after catheterization, and DD kept fluctuating at a high level, highly suggesting the possibility of venous thrombosis. The nursing staff should keep high vigilance and give appropriate nursing intervention. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['*Catheterization, Central Venous' 'Early Diagnosis' 'Humans'

28665468,2017,Impact of arm selection on the incidence of PICC complications: results of a randomized controlled trial. ,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to determine if right arm peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) experienced fewer complications while controlling for gender, hand dominance, history of malignancy, dwell time and catheter size. METHODS: This was an intention-to-treat randomized controlled trial conducted in an academic medical center on two different sites between September 2012 and September 2015. All patients older than 18 years or age without known history of previous central line, contraindication to the use of a specific arm or hospitalized in the intensive care unit regardless of coagulation status, were considered for the study. Participants were randomized to the left or right arm group and were followed until catheter removal. Data collected included: PICC characteristics, insertion details, gender, arm dominance, history of malignancy, reason for insertion/removal, incidence of a complication and total dwell time. One-tailed hypothesis testing using a univariate logistic regression with odds ratio (OR) calculation was used to analyze the results. There were 202 patients randomly assigned, totaling 7657 catheter-days; 103 patients to the right-side group and 99 patients to the left-side group. RESULTS: Participants in both groups were statistically equivalent for right handedness, gender, oncologic status, average dwell time and total catheter days. The overall incidence of complications on the right side was 23% versus 34% on the left side, confirming the hypothesis that right-sided insertions led to fewer complications (p = 0.046). The risk of a complication was reduced by 40% with right-sided insertion (OR 0.58 (CI: 0.31-1.09). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated fewer complications with right-sided insertion irrespective of hand dominance. ",['eng'],"['Comparative Study' 'Journal Article' 'Multicenter Study'

37166852,2023,The Association of Vasopressor Administration through a Midline Catheter with Catheter-related Complications. ,"Rationale: Little is known about the safety of infusing vasopressors through a midline catheter. Objectives: To evaluate safety outcomes after vasopressor administration through a midline. Methods: We conducted a cohort study of adults admitted to 39 hospitals in Michigan (December 2017-March 2022) who received vasopressors while either a midline or peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) was in place. Patients receiving vasopressors through a midline were compared with those receiving vasopressors through a PICC and, separately, to those with midlines in place but who received vasopressors through a different catheter. We used descriptive statistics to characterize and compare cohort characteristics. Multivariable mixed effects logistic regression models were fit to determine the association between vasopressor administration through a midline with outcomes, primarily catheter-related complications (bloodstream infection, superficial thrombophlebitis, exit site infection, or catheter occlusion). Results: Our cohort included 287 patients with midlines through which vasopressors were administered, 1,660 with PICCs through which vasopressors were administered, and 884 patients with midlines who received vasopressors through a separate catheter. Age (median [interquartile range]: 68.7 [58.6-75.7], 66.6 [57.1-75.0], and 67.6 [58.7-75.8] yr) and gender (percentage female: 50.5%, 47.3%, and 43.8%) were similar in all groups. The frequency of catheter-related complications was lower in patients with midlines used for vasopressors than PICCs used for vasopressors (5.2% vs. 13.4%; P < 0.001) but similar to midlines with vasopressor administration through a different device (5.2% vs. 6.3%; P = 0.49). After adjustment, administration of vasopressors through a midline was not associated with catheter-related complications compared with PICCs with vasopressors (adjusted odds ratios [aOR], 0.65 [95% confidence interval, 0.31-1.33]; P = 0.23) or midlines with vasopressors elsewhere (aOR, 0.85 [0.46-1.58]; P = 0.59). Midlines used for vasopressors were associated with greater risk of systemic thromboembolism (vs. PICCs with vasopressors: aOR, 2.69 [1.31-5.49]; P = 0.008; vs. midlines with vasopressors elsewhere: aOR, 2.42 [1.29-4.54]; P = 0.008) but not thromboses restricted to the ipsilateral upper extremity (vs. PICCs with vasopressors: aOR, 2.35 [0.83-6.63]; P = 0.10; model did not converge for vs. midlines with vasopressors elsewhere). Conclusions: We found no significant association of vasopressor administration through a midline with catheter-related complications. However, we identified increased odds of systemic (but not ipsilateral upper extremity) venous thromboembolism warranting further evaluation.

33950754,2021,Comparison of peripherally inserted central catheters and totally implanted venous access devices as chemotherapy delivery routes in oncology patients: A retrospective cohort study. ,"This study aimed to evaluate peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) and totally implanted venous access devices (TIVADs) as chemotherapy delivery routes. From May 2016 to April 2019, patients with malignancies who had PICCs or TIVADs inserted for chemotherapy were enrolled. We reviewed the patients' medical records for information concerning demographics, comorbidities, catheter-related complications, and catheter -service days. All patients included in both groups were also assessed for complication-free catheter survival and completion rates of chemotherapy. A total of 467 catheter insertions (185 PICCs and 282 TIVADs) were included in this study. The PICCs were associated with a higher rate of complication-related catheter removal than TIVADs (hazard ratio, 6.5954; 95% confidence interval, 2.394-18.168; p<0.001). The completion of chemotherapy was observed in 77 (41.6%) patients with PICCs and 128 (45.4%) with TIVADs (p = 0.442). The mean duration of catheter service-days was shorter for the patients in the PICC group who completed chemotherapy than those in the TIVAD group (101.3 ± 93.2 vs 245.3 ± 115.9, respectively, p < 0.001). Although PICC was an independent risk factor for complication-related catheter removal, there was no difference in the chemotherapy completion rate between the groups. Therefore, PICCs need to be considered preferentially in patients who require a chemotherapy delivery route for short-term chemotherapy.

31487777,2019,Infectious Complications in Home Parenteral Nutrition: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Comparing Peripherally-Inserted Central Catheters with Other Central Catheters. ,"BACKGROUND: Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) has become a common therapy. There is still controversy regarding the possibility that peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) may diminish catheter-related blood stream infection (CRBSI) rates. METHODS: We searched the PubMed database for studies reporting the rates of CRBSI with HPN. Study selection was performed independently by three investigators. Disagreements were discussed and resolved by consensus or by arbitration by an author not involved in the search. The National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tools was used to assess the methodological quality of the studies. Meta-analyses were performed using MetaXL 5.3 with the quality effects model. RESULTS: Screening of the article titles and abstracts yielded 134 full text articles for evaluation. Only three prospective studies that included appropriate data were considered for the final analysis. The relative risk of the CRBSI rate was 0.41 (0.14-1.17) for PICC vs. tunneled catheters. The relative risk of the CRBSI rate was 0.16 (0.04-0.64) for PICC vs. ports. The relative risk of the thrombosis rate was 3.16 (0.20-49.67) for PICCs vs. tunneled. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to show a difference in CRBSI rates between PICCs and tunneled catheters. On the other hand, PICCs showed lower CRBSI rates than ports. There was also no difference in the rate of catheter-related thrombosis and mechanical complications.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of 135 patients undergoing port placement for palliative chemotherapy at a single institution from January 2015 - July 2020. RESULTS: The median age was 68 (range 47-91). Median overall survival was 7.7 months (95% CI, 6.5-8.9 months). The rate of port-related complications was 11.1% (15 of 135). Patients who developed port-related complications required corrective surgery in 73.3% (11 of 15) of cases. Results were similar among all patients, regardless of their primary diagnoses or central venous access sites. CONCLUSIONS: Increased awareness about the limited survival of patients after port placement for palliative chemotherapy, and their significant complication risk could be used to help patients and their providers make value-aligned decisions about vascular access.

25329204,2014,Do clinicians know which of their patients have central venous catheters?: a multicenter observational study. ,"BACKGROUND: Complications associated with central venous catheters (CVCs) increase over time. Although early removal of unnecessary CVCs is important to prevent complications, the extent to which clinicians are aware that their patients have a CVC is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess how often clinicians were unaware of the presence of triple-lumen catheters or peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in hospitalized patients. DESIGN: Multicenter, cross-sectional study. SETTING: 3 academic medical centers in the United States. PATIENTS: Hospitalized medical patients in intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU settings. MEASUREMENTS: To ascertain awareness of CVCs, whether a PICC or triple-lumen catheter was present was determined; clinicians were then queried about device presence. Differences in device awareness among clinicians were assessed by chi-square tests. RESULTS: 990 patients were evaluated, and 1881 clinician assessments were done. The overall prevalence of CVCs was 21.1% (n=209), of which 60.3% (126 of 209) were PICCs. A total of 21.2% (90 of 425) of clinicians interviewed were unaware of the presence of a CVC. Unawareness was greatest among patients with PICCs, where 25.1% (60 of 239) of clinicians were unaware of PICC presence. Teaching attendings and hospitalists were more frequently unaware of the presence of CVCs than interns and residents (25.8% and 30.5%, respectively, vs. 16.4%). Critical care physicians were more likely to be aware of CVC presence than general medicine physicians (12.6% vs. 26.2%; P=0.003). LIMITATIONS: Awareness was determined at 1 point in time and was not linked to outcomes. Patient length of stay and indication for CVC were not recorded. CONCLUSION: Clinicians are frequently unaware of the presence of PICCs and triple-lumen catheters in hospitalized patients. Further study of mechanisms that ensure that clinicians are aware of these devices so that they may assess their necessity seems warranted. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: None.

33104421,2020,Misplacement of piccs following power-injected CT contrast media. ,"Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) may be used to administer contrast injection during CT (computed tomography) scans to improve diagnostic accuracy. This is usually done with the use of a power injector. Research has shown that misplacement of catheters following contrast injection can occur. The aim of this review was to analyse appropriately positioned pre-scan PICCs that malposition following injection of contrast media during a CT scan, evaluate whether tip location or right or left insertion plays a part in the displacement of PICCs after CT, and to ensure those involved are aware of the risks and the safety checks required following such procedures. A quantitative method was used, gathering information from the team's insertion database to review 2045 records of contrast-injectable PICCs between 1 January 2015 and 30 April 2020. Analysis of the data indicated that 1% of appropriately sited PICCs malposition following contrast CT injection and that the catheter is able to self-correct back to its original position at an average interval of 24-72 hours without any other intervention. Further research is needed to explore other factors that could influence the rate of self-correction and complications of prolonged catheter malposition.

30501549,2019,"Peripherally inserted central catheter, midline, and ""short"" midline in palliative care: Patient-reported outcome measures to assess impact on quality of care. ","OBJECTIVES: A prospective, observational study was conducted in our palliative care unit to assess the impact of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), midline, and ""short"" midline catheters on the quality of care in cancer and non-cancer patients. The secondary objective was to assess pain and distress during vascular access device insertion. METHODS: Patients were recruited if they underwent insertion of a PICC, midline, or ""short"" midline catheter as part of their standard care. The Palliative care Outcome Scale was used to assess changes in quality of care after vascular access device positioning. A numerical rating scale was used to measure pain intensity during catheter insertion. RESULTS: Of the 90 patients enrolled, 52.2% were male with a mean age of 73.0 ± 13 years. Among these patients, 64.4% patients underwent ""short"" midline insertion, 26.7% PICC, and 8.9% midline catheter. The patients' mean baseline Palliative care Outcome Scale score was 15.7 ± 5.6. Three days after vascular access device positioning, the patients' mean Palliative care Outcome Scale score was 11.5 ± 5.5 (p < 0.0001). Mean pain score during vascular access device insertion was 1.26 ± 1.63, and mean procedural distress score was 1.78 ± 1.93. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that medium-term intravenous catheters can have a favorable impact on quality of care and the procedures for these vascular access device insertions are well tolerated. Further research on the performance of different vascular access devices and their appropriateness in palliative care should be encouraged.

28416559,2017,A Novel Nonantibiotic Nitroglycerin-Based Catheter Lock Solution for Prevention of Intraluminal Central Venous Catheter Infections in Cancer Patients. ,"For long-term central lines (CL), the lumen is the major source of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI). The current standard of care for maintaining catheter patency includes flushing the CL with saline or heparin. Neither agent has any antimicrobial activity. Furthermore, heparin may enhance staphylococcal biofilm formation. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of a novel nonantibiotic catheter lock solution for the prevention of CLABSI. Between November 2015 and February 2016, we enrolled 60 patients with hematologic malignancies who had peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) to receive the study lock solution. The study lock consisted of 15 or 30 μg/ml of nitroglycerin in combination with 4% sodium citrate and 22% ethanol. Each lumen was locked for at least 2 h once daily prior to being flushed. After enrollment of 10 patients at the lower nitroglycerin dose without evidence of toxicity, the dose was escalated to the higher dose (30 μg/ml). There were no serious related adverse events or episodes of hypotension with lock administration. Two patients experienced mild transient adverse events (one headache and one rash) possibly related to the lock and that resolved without residual effect. The CLABSI rate was 0 on lock days versus 1.6/1,000 catheter days (CD) off lock prophylaxis, compared with a rate of 1.9/1,000 CD at the institution in the same patient population. In conclusion, the nitroglycerin-based lock prophylaxis is safe and well tolerated. It may prevent CLABSI when given daily to cancer patients. Large, prospective, randomized clinical trials are needed to validate these findings. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier NCT02577718.).

25374804,2014,Focus on peripherally inserted central catheters in critically ill patients. ,"Venous access devices are of pivotal importance for an increasing number of critically ill patients in a variety of disease states and in a variety of clinical settings (emergency, intensive care, surgery) and for different purposes (fluids or drugs infusions, parenteral nutrition, antibiotic therapy, hemodynamic monitoring, procedures of dialysis/apheresis). However, healthcare professionals are commonly worried about the possible consequences that may result using a central venous access device (CVAD) (mainly, bloodstream infections and thrombosis), both peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) and centrally inserted central catheters (CICCs). This review aims to discuss indications, insertion techniques, and care of PICCs in critically ill patients. PICCs have many advantages over standard CICCs. First of all, their insertion is easy and safe -due to their placement into peripheral veins of the arm- and the advantage of a central location of catheter tip suitable for all osmolarity and pH solutions. Using the ultrasound-guidance for the PICC insertion, the risk of hemothorax and pneumothorax can be avoided, as well as the possibility of primary malposition is very low. PICC placement is also appropriate to avoid post-procedural hemorrhage in patients with an abnormal coagulative state who need a CVAD. Some limits previously ascribed to PICCs (i.e., low flow rates, difficult central venous pressure monitoring, lack of safety for radio-diagnostic procedures, single-lumen) have delayed their start up in the intensive care units as common practice. Though, the recent development of power-injectable PICCs overcomes these technical limitations and PICCs have started to spread in critical care settings. Two important take-home messages may be drawn from this review. First, the incidence of complications varies depending on venous accesses and healthcare professionals should be aware of the different clinical performance as well as of the different risks associated with each type of CVAD (CICCs or PICCs). Second, an inappropriate CVAD choice and, particularly, an inadequate insertion technique are relevant-and often not recognized-potential risk factors for complications in critically ill patients. We strongly believe that all healthcare professionals involved in the choice, insertion or management of CVADs in critically ill patients should know all potential risk factors of complications. This knowledge may minimize complications and guarantee longevity to the CVAD optimizing the risk/benefit ratio of CVAD insertion and use. Proper management of CVADs in critical care saves lines and lives. Much evidence from the medical literature and from the clinical practice supports our belief that, compared to CICCs, the so-called power-injectable peripherally inserted central catheters are a good alternative choice in critical care.

35484279,2022,A prospective randomized controlled trial assessing the effect of music on patients' anxiety in venous catheter placement procedures. ,"The aim of the study was to assess the influence of music on anxiety levels compared to standard patient care in patients undergoing venous catheter placement procedures. This prospective randomized controlled trial included patients undergoing placement procedures for peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICC), ports and central venous catheters (CVC). Patients were randomly assigned to a music intervention group (MIG) and a control group (CTRL). State and trait anxiety levels were assessed as primary outcome using the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) before and after the procedures. Secondary outcomes comprised averaged heart rate for all participants and time of radiological surveillance for port placement procedures exclusively. 72 participants were included into the final analysis (MIG n = 40; CTRL n = 32). All procedures were successful and no major complications were reported. Mean levels for post-interventional anxieties were significantly lower in the MIG compared to the CTRL (34.9 ± 8.9 vs. 44 ± 12.1; p < 0.001). Mean heart rate in the MIG was significantly lower than in the CTRL (76.1 ± 13.7 vs. 93 ± 8.9; p < 0.001). Procedure time for port implantation was significantly longer in the MIG by 3 min 45 s (p = 0.031). Music exposure during central venous catheter placement procedures highly significantly reduces anxiety and stress levels and can be used to improve patients' overall experience in the angio suite.

37151085,2023,Multinational prospective cohort study of incidence and risk factors for central line-associated bloodstream infections over 18 years in 281 ICUs of 9 Asian countries. ,"BACKGROUND: Our objective was to identify central line (CL)-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) rates and risk factors (RF) in Asia. METHODS: From 03/27/2004 to 02/11/2022, we conducted a multinational multicenter prospective cohort study in 281 ICUs of 95 hospitals in 44 cities in 9 Asian countries (China, India, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam). For estimation of CLABSI rate we used CL-days as denominator and number of CLABSI as numerator. To estimate CLABSI RF for we analyzed the data using multiple logistic regression, and outcomes are shown as adjusted odds ratios (aOR). RESULTS: A total of 150,142 patients, hospitalized 853,604 days, acquired 1514 CLABSIs. Pooled CLABSI rate per 1000 CL-days was 5.08; per type of catheter were: femoral: 6.23; temporary hemodialysis: 4.08; jugular: 4.01; arterial: 3.14; PICC: 2.47; subclavian: 2.02. The highest rates were femoral, temporary for hemodialysis, and jugular, and the lowest PICC and subclavian. We analyzed following variables: Gender, age, length of stay (LOS) before CLABSI acquisition, CL-days before CLABSI acquisition, CL-device utilization ratio, CL-type, tracheostomy use, hospitalization type, ICU type, facility ownership and World Bank classifications by income level. Following were independently associated with CLABSI: LOS before CLABSI acquisition, rising risk 4% daily (aOR = 1.04; 95% CI = 1.03-1.04; p < 0.0001); number of CL-days before CLABSI acquisition, rising risk 5% per CL-day (aOR = 1.05; 95% CI 1.05-1.06; p < 0.0001); medical hospitalization (aOR = 1.21; 95% CI 1.04-1.39; p = 0.01); tracheostomy use (aOR = 2.02;95% CI 1.43-2.86; p < 0.0001); publicly-owned facility (aOR = 3.63; 95% CI 2.54-5.18; p < 0.0001); lower-middle-income country (aOR = 1.87; 95% CI 1.41-2.47; p < 0.0001). ICU with highest risk was pediatric (aOR = 2.86; 95% CI 1.71-4.82; p < 0.0001), followed by medical-surgical (aOR = 2.46; 95% CI 1.62-3.75; p < 0.0001). CL with the highest risk were internal-jugular (aOR = 3.32; 95% CI 2.84-3.88; p < 0.0001), and femoral (aOR = 3.13; 95% CI 2.48-3.95; p < 0.0001), and subclavian (aOR = 1.78; 95% CI 1.47-2.15; p < 0.0001) showed the lowest risk. CONCLUSIONS: The following CLABSI RFs are unlikely to change: country income level, facility-ownership, hospitalization type, and ICU type. Based on these findings it is suggested to focus on reducing LOS, CL-days, and tracheostomy; using subclavian or PICC instead of internal-jugular or femoral; and implementing evidence-based CLABSI prevention recommendations.

METHODS: This study involved a population-based retrospective analysis of insurance claims made by patients who underwent rhinoplasty between 2007 and 2016. Established risk factors for VTE, demographic data, procedural details, and absolute incidence of VTE were collected. RESULTS: We identified a total of 55,287 patients who underwent rhinoplasty from 2007 to 2016. Mean age [standard error of the mean] was 38.74 [0.06] years (range, 18-74 years), and 54% were female. The overall incidence of VTE was 111, of which 70 were DVT and 41 were PE. From multivariate regression analysis, previous VTE (odds ratio [OR], 52.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 35.2-78.6; P < 0.0001), peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)/central line placement (OR, 19.6; 95% CI, 9.8-153; P < 0.05), rib graft (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 2.3-8.5; P < 0.0001), age 41 to 60 years (OR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.7-4.3; P < 0.01), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.0-5.5; P < 0.05), and age 61 to 74 years (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2-4.8; P < 0.05) were associated with an increased risk of VTE. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a low overall incidence of VTE in rhinoplasty patients. Previous VTE, PICC/central line, advancing age, IBD, and intraoperative rib graft harvest were most strongly associated with VTE in this population cohort.

A case-control study was conducted comparing patients with PRUEVT versus patients with PICCs who did not develop PRUEVT. BG on admission was significantly higher among cases with PRUEVT than controls. No significant differences were found between the groups in hemoglobin A1c or BG on the third day of hospitalization. PRUEVT cases were more likely to be diabetic, but this did not reach statistical significance. The time that a PICC was in place before PRUEVT was diagnosed was longer for diabetic patients, but the authors believe this result must be viewed with caution.

26010361,2015,Clinical and therapeutic aspects of candidemia: a five year single centre study. ,"BACKGROUND: Candida is an important cause of bloodstream infections (BSI) in nosocomial settings causing significant mortality and morbidity. This study was performed to evaluate contemporary epidemiology, species distribution, antifungal susceptibility and outcome of candida BSI in an Italian hospital. METHODS: All consecutive patients who developed candidemia at Santa Maria della Misericordia University Hospital (Italy) between January 2009 and June 2014 were enrolled in the study. RESULTS: A total of 204 episodes of candidemia were identified during the study period with an incidence of 0.79 episodes/1000 admissions. C. albicans was isolated in 60.3% of cases, followed by C. parapsilosis (16.7%), C. glabrata (11.8%) and C. tropicalis (6.4%). Of all Candida BSI, 124 (60.8 %) occurred in patients admitted to IMW, 31/204 (15.2 %) in ICUs, 33/204 (16.2%) in surgical units and 16/204 (7.8%) in Hematology/Oncology wards. Overall, 47% of patients died within 30 days from the onset of candidemia. C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata candidemia were associated with the lowest mortality rate (36%), while patients with C. tropicalis BSI had the highest mortality rate (58.3%). Lower mortality rates were detected in patients receiving therapy within 48 hours from the time of execution of the blood cultures (57,1% vs 38,9%, P < 0.05). At multivariate analysis, steroids treatment (OR = 0.27, p = 0.005) and CVC removal (OR = 3.77, p = 0.014) were independently associated with lower and higher survival probability, respectively. Candidemia in patients with peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) showed to be associated with higher mortality in comparison with central venous catheters (CVC, Short catheters and Portacath) and no CVC use. For each point increase of APACHE III score, survival probability decreased of 2%. Caspofungin (OR = 3.45, p = 0.015) and Amphothericin B lipid formulation (OR = 15.26, p = 0.033) were independently associated with higher survival probability compared with no treatment.

31294320,2019,Apixaban for Routine Management of Upper Extremity Deep Venous Thrombosis (ARM-DVT): Methods of a prospective single-arm management study. ,"BACKGROUND: Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT) constitutes approximately 10% of all deep vein thromboses (DVTs). The incidence of UEDVT is increasing in association with use of peripherally inserted central venous catheters. Treatment for UEDVT is derived largely from evidence for treatment of lower extremity DVT. Limited evidence exists for the use of a direct oral anticoagulant for the treatment of UEDVT. POPULATION: Sequential patients identified within the Intermountain Healthcare System and University of Utah Healthcare system with symptomatic UEDVT defined as the formation of thrombus within the internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, ulnar, or radial veins of the arm. INTERVENTION: Apixaban 10 mg PO twice daily for 7 days followed by apixaban 5 mg twice daily for 11 weeks. COMPARISON: The historical literature review rate of venous thrombosis reported for recurrent clinically overt objective venous thromboembolism (VTE) and VTE-related death. If the confidence interval for the observed rate excludes the threshold event rate of 4%, we will conclude that treatment with apixaban is noninferior and therefore a clinically valid approach to treat UEDVT. SAMPLE SIZE: We elected a sample size of 375 patients so that an exact 95% confidence interval would exclude an event rate of VTE in the observation cohort of 4%. OUTCOME: Ninety-day rate of new or recurrent objectively confirmed symptomatic venous thrombosis and VTE-related death. The primary safety outcome is the composite of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],[],"['PICC line' 'apixaban' 'cancer' 'central venous catheter'

28413891,2018,Safety of peripherally inserted central catheters during pregnancy: a retrospective study. ,"PURPOSE: We investigated the incidence of complications associated with peripherally inserted central line catheters, inserted using a standardized technique, during pregnancy and the postpartum period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case series was performed that included all pregnant and postpartum women who received peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) at a single institution between 2006 and 2014. Patient demographics and data on infectious, mechanical and thrombotic complications were collected. Some patients required more than one line insertion during the same pregnancy. In these instances, only the first line placement for each subject was included in the analysis of complications. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-six catheters were inserted in 112 pregnant and postpartum patients. The total incidence of complications was 17% (19/112). Specific complications included infection (n = 4, 3.6%), mechanical (n = 5, 4.4%), deep venous thrombosis (n = 2, 1.8%) and other (n = 8, 7.1%). Demographics of the complication and no complication groups were similar. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with previous studies, we report a complication rate associated with peripheral line use in pregnant and postpartum women that appears similar to that in non-pregnant populations.

37716948,2023,Implementation of a vascular access specialist team in a tertiary hospital: a cost-benefit analysis. ,"BACKGROUND: The use of peripherally inserted central catheters and midline catheters is growing due to their potential benefits. These devices can increase patient safety and satisfaction while reducing the use of resources. As a result, many hospitals are establishing vascular access specialist teams staffed by nurses who are trained in the insertion and maintenance of these catheters. The objective of the study is to evaluate previously to the implementation whether the benefits of introducing ultrasound-guided peripheral venous catheters, midline catheters and peripherally inserted central catheters compared to current practice by a vascular access specialist team outweigh their costs. METHODS: Cost-benefit analysis from the perspective of the healthcare provider based on administrative data. The study estimates the reduction in resources used when changing the current practice for the use of ultrasound-guided midline and PICC catheters, as well as the additional resources required for their use. RESULTS: The use of an ultrasound-guided device on peripherally inserted central carheter, results in a measurable resource reduction of approximately €31. When 3 peripheral venous catheters are replaced by an ultrasound-guided peripherally inserted central catheter, the saving is €63. Similarly, the use of an ultrasound-guided device on a midline catheter, results in a reduction of €16, while each ultrasound-guided midline catheter replacing 3 peripheral venous catheters results in a reduction of €96. CONCLUSION: The benefits of using ultrasound-guided midline and PICC catheters compared to current practice by introducing a vascular access specialist team trained in the implantation of ultrasound-guided catheters, outweigh its cost mainly because of the decrease in hospital stay due to the lowered risk of phebitis. These results motivate the implementation of the service, adding to previous experience suggesting that it is also preferable from the point of view of patient safety and satisfaction.

34258686,2021,The MOBILISE study: utilisation of ambulatory pumps in the inpatient setting to administer continuous antibiotic infusions-a randomised controlled trial. ,"In the inpatient setting, antibiotics are generally administered via bedside pumps with multiple daily dosing. Utilisation of a continuous antibiotic infusion (CAI) instead might have patient and nursing satisfaction, workflow efficiencies and infection control benefits. We aimed to study the utilisation of CAI in the inpatient setting for routine antibiotic administration. Patients receiving a peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) for antibiotic administration were screened for the study. The patients were randomised to either (1) standard pump and intermittent antibiotic administration (IAA) or (2) CAI via an ambulatory pump. An accelerometer placed on the ankle was used to assess patient activity. Nursing and patient satisfaction surveys were also carried out. Forty patients met the study criteria for enrolment with 21 patients being enrolled in the CAI arm of the study. One hundred and five days of accelerometer recordings were available for analysis. The geometric mean activity was 45 min/day in the standard arm and 64 min/day in the CAI arm. This represented a 42% (95% CI: -14 to 133%, p = 0.16) difference in activity between the two groups. Nursing staff reported that they spent less time throughout their shift attending the antibiotic line or pump in patients who were in the CAI arm of the study (p < 0.001). In addition, patients in this arm of the study were more likely to recommend this method of administration of antibiotics to a family member (p =0.0001). The MOBILISE study showed nursing and patient satisfaction when CAI were utilised in the inpatient setting. A statistically non-significant difference in mobility was seen.

29562836,2018,The Valsalva manoeuvre versus tourniquet for venipuncture. ,"BACKGROUND: During ultrasound-guided cannulation, venous filling is required for venipuncture. Tourniquet with an elastic tube at the axilla is the most common method to induce venous stasis for cannulation of the deep veins of the arm. Although effective, this method might be associated with short- and long-term complications. Valsalva manoeuvre has been used to produce venous filling in other extrathoracic veins. The aim of this observational study is to demonstrate the effect of Valsalva manoeuvre in respect of the elastic tourniquet on venous distention during echography-guided cannulation of the deep veins of the arm. METHOD: Sixty-nine patients scheduled for cannulation of basilic or brachial vein were prospectively observed. Vein diameters were recorded at rest and after 10 s of Valsalva or tourniquet placement. RESULTS: The mean difference between basilic vein diameters during tourniquet and Valsalva manoeuvre was 0.006 mm (95% confidence interval = -inf, 0.09) with a standard deviation of 0.5 mm (95% confidence interval = 0.5, 0.7; p > 0.01). The mean difference between brachial vein diameters during tourniquet and Valsalva manoeuvre was 0.04 mm (95% confidence interval = -0.23, 0.15) with a standard deviation of 0.8 mm (95% confidence interval = 0.7, 0.9; p > 0.01). DISCUSSION: This increase in cross-sectional basilic and brachial vein diameters was not different to that obtained with the elastic tube tourniquet.

35847566,2022,"Design and protocol of the Buprenorphine plus Outpatient Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy (B-OPAT) study: a randomized clinical trial of integrated outpatient treatment of opioid use disorder and severe, injection-related infections. ","INTRODUCTION: A marked increase in hospitalizations for severe, injection-related infections (SIRI) has been associated with the opioid epidemic. Outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT) is typically not offered to persons with opioid use disorder (OUD) and SIRI, though increasing evidence suggests it may be feasible and safe. This study evaluates the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an integrated care model combining Buprenorphine treatment of OUD with OPAT for SIRI (B-OPAT) compared with treatment as usual on key OUD, infectious disease, and health economic outcomes. B-OPAT expands and incorporates key elements of established clinical models, including inpatient initiation of buprenorphine for OUD, inpatient infectious disease consultation for SIRI, office-based treatment of OUD, and OPAT, and includes more frequent clinical outpatient visits than standard OPAT. A qualitative evaluation is included to contextualize effectiveness outcomes and identify barriers and facilitators to intervention adoption and implementation. METHODS: B-OPAT is a single-site, randomized, parallel-group, superiority trial recruiting 90 adult inpatients hospitalized with OUD and SIRI who require at least 2 weeks of intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy. After screening, eligible participants are randomized 1:1 to either discharge once medically stable to an integrated outpatient treatment care model combining Buprenorphine and OPAT (B-OPAT) or to Treatment As Usual (TAU). The primary outcome measure is the proportion of urine samples negative for illicit opioids in the 12 weeks after discharge from the hospital. Key secondary OUD outcomes include self-reported number of days of illicit opioid abstinence and 12-week retention in buprenorphine treatment. The infection outcomes are completion of recommended IV antibiotic therapy, peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) complications, and readmission related to primary SIRI. CONCLUSIONS: The B-OPAT study will help address the important question of whether it is clinically effective and cost-effective to discharge persons with OUD and SIRI to an integrated outpatient care model combining OUD treatment with OPAT relative to TAU (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT04677114).

28163887,2017,Central venous access related adverse events after trabectedin infusions in soft tissue sarcoma patients; experience and management in a nationwide multi-center study. ,"BACKGROUND: Trabectedin has shown efficacy against soft tissue sarcomas (STS) and has manageable toxicity. Trabectedin is administered through central venous access devices (VAD), such as subcutaneous ports with tunneled catheters, Hickman catheters and PICC lines. Venous access related adverse events are common, but have not yet been reported in detail. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patient files of STS patients receiving trabectedin monotherapy between 1999 and 2014 was performed in all five STS referral centers in the Netherlands. This survey focused on adverse events related to the VAD and the actions taken in response to these events. RESULTS: In the 127 patients included in this analysis, 102 venous access ports (VAP), 15 Hickman catheters and 10 PICC lines were used as primary means of central venous access. The most frequently reported adverse events at the VAD site were erythema (30.7%), pain (28.3%), inflammation (11.8%) and thrombosis (11.0%). Actions taken towards these adverse events include oral antibiotics (17.3%), VAD replacement (15.0%) or a wait-and-see policy (13.4%). In total, 45 patients (35.4%) with a subcutaneous port developed a varying degree of inflammation along the trajectory of the tunneled catheter. In all but three patients, this was a sterile inflammation, which was considered a unique phenomenon for trabectedin. Microscopic leakage of trabectedin along the venous access device and catheter was considered the most plausible cause for this adverse event. Placing the catheter deeper under the skin resolved the issue almost completely. CONCLUSION: Trabectedin infusion commonly leads to central venous access related adverse events. Sterile inflammation along the catheter trajectory is one of the most common adverse events and can be prevented by placing the catheter deeper under the skin.

29293304,2017,,"Central venous access devices (CVADs) or central venous catheters (CVCs) are devices that are inserted into the body through a vein to enable the administration of fluids, blood products, medication and other therapies to the bloodstream. CVADs can be inserted into the subclavian or jugular vein (implanted ports, tunneled catheters), or can be inserted into one of the peripheral veins of the upper extremities, called peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs). While generally safe, CVADs can be associated with complications such as catheter occlusion or rupture, venous thrombosis, and bloodstream infection. A number of strategies have been used to minimize the occurrence of CVAD- and PICC-associated complications such as antimicrobial-impregnated lines for prevention of infection, or addition of a valve (valved catheters) to prevent occlusion by preventing reflux of blood into the catheter. Flushing the catheters with saline or heparin – an agent with anticoagulant activity - have been used to reduce clot formation and occlusion of the catheters. This Rapid Response report is an update of the previous CADTH reports which found no difference in terms of frequency of occlusion in patients who had a valved versus a non-valved PICCs, and similar patency between heparin and saline use for CVCs.(,) This report aims to review the evidence on the clinical effectiveness of valved versus non-valved PICCs, and saline versus heparin flushing in the maintenance of CVADs patency and reduction of complications.

It is unknown if voiceover interactive PowerPoint (VOIPP) via digital video disc education improves clinical outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a quaternary care medical center and using a randomized, controlled, 2-group design, hospitalized patients with TC/PICC received usual care education or usual care (UC) plus VOIPP education prehospital discharge. A multiple-choice 6-item knowledge questionnaire was administered preeducation, immediately posteducation, and 7-10 days postdischarge. At 90 days, patients were assessed for CRBSI incidence rates per 1000 catheter-days, rehospitalization, CRBSI-related hospitalization, non-CRBSI complications and patient calls to the home parenteral nutrition (HPN) clinicians. Analysis of variance, Pearson χ(2), and Kruskal-Wallis test were used to compare results between groups. RESULTS: Of 51 patients (UC, n = 27; UC+VOIPP, n = 24), mean ± SD age was 46.3 ± 14.3 years, 68.6% were female, HPN duration was 2.2 ± 1.01 months, and time to postdischarge test completion was 11.5 ± 5.2 days. There were no baseline differences between groups. Between-group knowledge and changes in knowledge were similar at preeducation, immediate posteducation, and postdischarge (P = .88, 0.30, and 0.37, respectively). There were no differences in CRBSI incidence, rehospitalization, CRBSI-related rehospitalization rates, and non-CRBSI complications between groups. The UC+VOIPP group had more patient calls than did the UC group (21.8 vs 7.7 calls/1000 catheter-days, P < .001). CONCLUSION: Recorded education led to more patient calls to the HPN clinicians; however, there were no differences between groups in other outcomes.

35285085,2022,Retrospective analysis of the safety of peripherally inserted catheters versus implanted port catheters during first-line treatment for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. ,"OBJECTIVES: Both peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) and implanted port catheters (PORTs) are commonly used for the delivery of immunochemotherapy. We compared the safety of the two types of devices in a homogeneous and monocentric population of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients who were treated with first-line immunochemotherapy by evaluating the numbers of catheter-related venous thromboses (VTs) and infections that occurred in the six months after implantation according to the type of device. METHODS: Using a propensity score, the adjusted relative risk (ARR) between the type of catheter and the occurrence of catheter-related complications (infection and/or VT) of interest was retrospectively determined. RESULTS: 479 patients were enrolled (266 PORTs/213 PICCs), and 26 VTs (5.4%) and 30 infections (6.3%) were identified in the period following PICC/PORT implantation. The adjusted relative risk (ARR) of catheter-related complications (infection and/or VT) according to the type of device was 2.6 (95% CI =1.3-5.9, p = .0075). This risk increase associated with the PICC device was significant for both infections (ARR = 3.2; 95% CI = 1.3-10.9) and thrombosis (ARR = 4; 95% CI = 1.5-11.6).

The spread of multidrug-resistant bacterial (MDR) strains is an emerging clinical problem and more and more patients are being colonized by these types of bacteria. The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of central line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) or catheter related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) in mid-thigh catheters in patients with positive rectal swabs to evaluate the safety of this procedure and the real infection risk. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we analyzed data on patients with mid-tight catheters inserted from May 2021 to November 2022. All surveillance rectal swabs were recorded. In addition, to collect data on CLABSI and CRBSI, the results of all blood and catheter tip cultures performed during the hospital stay were acquired. RESULTS: Six hundred two patients were enrolled, 304 patients (50.5%) had a rectal swab; 128 (42.1%) swabs were positive for MDR. Nine CLABSI (only two in patients with a positive rectal swab) and three CRBSI were detected. No statistical difference in the absolute number of CLABSI and CRBSI and in the number of infections per 1000 catheter days emerged between the overall population and patients with positive rectal swabs (respectively p = 0.45 and p = 0.53). Similarly, no statistical difference in the number of CLABSI and CRBSI was found among patients with a negative swab and patients with a positive one (respectively p = 0.43 and p = 0.51). CONCLUSIONS: According to our data, cannulation of the superficial femoral vein represents a safe location in patients with positive rectal swabs.

We report our experience with 60 cases of CTA tunneling: 19 patients requiring a totally implantable device, who had bilateral contraindication to venous access at the arm and bilateral contraindication to placement of the pocket in the infra-clavicular area; 41 patients requiring an external central venous catheter, who had bilateral contraindication to insertion of peripherally inserted central catheters or femoral catheters, as well as contraindication to an exit site in the infraclavicular area. All venous access devices were inserted with ultrasound guidance and tip location by intracavitary electrocardiography, under local anesthesia. RESULTS: There were no immediate or early complications. Patients with CTA-ports had no late complications. In patients with CTA-tunneled external catheters, there were two dislodgments, four episodes of central line associated blood stream infections, and one local infection. There were no episodes of venous thrombosis or catheter malfunction. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that CTA tunneling is a safe maneuver, with very low risk of complications, and should be considered as an option in patients with complex venous access.

33129962,2021,"The efficacy of midline catheters-a prospective, randomized, active-controlled study. ","OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to investigate whether an intravenous (IV) strategy based on new-generation midline catheters is an efficacious alternative to a conventional IV strategy consisting of peripheral venous catheters and central venous catheters, for patients needing IV therapy exceeding 5 days. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, controlled study. Patients requiring more than 5 days of IV treatment were randomized to either a midline catheter-based IV strategy or a conventional strategy. The primary endpoint was the composite of the insertion of a central venous catheter (CVC) or the need for four or more peripheral venous catheter (PVC) insertions. The secondary outcomes included catheter dwell times and reasons for premature removal. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty patients were included. The fraction of patients receiving four or more PVCs or having a CVC inserted was 12/58 (21%) in the midline group versus 38/58 (66%) in the conventional group (p <  0.001); the number needed to treat was 2.2. The median overall catheter dwell time was 7 days (range 0-60 days) in the midline group and 4 days (range 0-84 days) in the conventional group (p =  0.002). CONCLUSION: In patients requiring more than 5 days of IV therapy, a midline catheter strategy reduced the need for insertion of a CVC or four or more PVCs.

35780253,2022,Peripherally inserted central venous catheters decrease central line-associated bloodstream infections and change microbiological epidemiology in adult hematology unit: a propensity score-adjusted analysis. ,"Peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) have a potential advantage in preventing central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) compared with the centrally inserted ones (CICCs). However, due to a limited number of studies with insufficient statistical evaluation, the superiority of PICCs is difficult to be generalized in adult hematology unit. We conducted a single-center retrospective study and compared the risk of CLABSI between 472 CICCs and 557 PICCs inserted in adult patients with hematological disorders through conventional multivariate models and a propensity score-adjusted analysis. The overall CLABSI incidence in CICCs and PICCs was 5.11 and 3.29 per 1000 catheter days (P = 0.024). The multivariate Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.31-0.75; P = 0.001) and Fine-Gray subdistribution analysis (HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.37-0.93; P = 0.023) demonstrated that PICC was independently associated with a reduced risk of CLABSI. Moreover, the stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting analysis, which further reduced the selection bias between CICCs and PICCs, showed that PICCs significantly prevented CLABSI (HR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.35-0.94; P = 0.029). Microbiologically, PICCs showed a significant decrease in gram-positive cocci (P = 0.001) and an increase in gram-positive bacilli (P = 0.002) because of a remarkable reduction in Staphylococci and increase in Corynebacterium species responsible for CLABSI. Our study confirmed that PICC was a superior alternative to CICC in preventing CLABSI in the adult hematology unit, while it posed a microbiological shift in local epidemiology.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective multicenter cohort of consecutive patients who underwent PICC placement from October 2016 to September 2017 at four institutes was assembled. Using multivariable logistic and Cox-proportional hazards regression models, all risk factors were analyzed for their association with PBSI. Multivariable logistic models were used to evaluate predictors of PBSI-related death. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 929 PICCs were inserted in 746 patients for a total of 17,913 catheter days. PBSI occurred in 58 patients (6.2%), with an infection rate of 3.23 per 1,000 catheter days. Number of catheter lumens [double lumen, odds ratio (OR) 5.295; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.220-12.627; hazard ration (HR) 3.569; 95% CI, 1.461-8.717], PICC for chemotherapy (OR 4.94; 95% CI, 1.686-14.458; HR 7.635; 95% CI, 2.775-21.007), and hospital length of stay (OR 2.23; 95% CI, 1.234-4.049; HR 1.249; 95% CI, 0.659-2.368) were associated with PBSI. Risk factors, such as receiving chemotherapy (OR 54.911; 95% CI, 2.755-1094.326), presence of diabetes (OR 11.712; 95% CI, 1.513-90.665), and advanced age (OR 1.116; 95% CI 1.007-1.238), were correlated with PBSI-related death. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that risk factors associated with PBSI included the number of catheter lumens, the use of PICCs for chemotherapy, and the hospital length of stay. Furthermore, PBSI-related death was common in patients undergoing chemotherapy, diabetics, and elderly patients. ",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial' 'Journal Article' 'Multicenter Study'

34688374,2022,"Neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade with toripalimab, with or without celecoxib, in mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high, locally advanced, colorectal cancer (PICC): a single-centre, parallel-group, non-comparative, randomised, phase 2 trial. ","BACKGROUND: PD-1 blockade is highly effective in patients with mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high metastatic colorectal cancer. The role of single-agent PD-1 blockade in the neoadjuvant setting for resectable mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high colorectal cancer remains unclear. We investigated the efficacy and safety of PD-1 blockade with toripalimab, with or without the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, as neoadjuvant treatment for mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high, locally advanced, colorectal cancers. METHODS: The PD-1 Inhibitor in Microsatellite Instability Colorectal Cancer (PICC) trial was a single-centre, open-label, parallel-group, non-comparative, randomised, phase 2 study undertaken at the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China). Eligible patients were aged 18-75 years, had histologically confirmed mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high colorectal cancer, had clinical stage T3-T4 or any T with lymph node positivity (N+), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0 or 1, and adequate haematological, hepatic, and renal function. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), without any stratification or balanced blocking, to receive toripalimab 3 mg/kg intravenously on day 1, with or without celecoxib 200 mg orally twice daily from day 1 to 14 of each 14-day cycle, for six cycles before surgical resection. Adjuvant treatment with toripalimab with or without celecoxib was permitted at the investigators' discretion. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with pathological complete response, defined as tumours without any viable tumour cells in the resected primary tumour sample and all sampled regional lymph nodes. All efficacy and safety analyses were assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all patients who were randomly assigned to treatment and who received at least one dose of toripalimab. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03926338, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between May 1, 2019, and April 1, 2021, 53 patients were screened, of whom 34 were randomly assigned to either the toripalimab plus celecoxib group (n=17) or the toripalimab monotherapy group (n=17). As of data cutoff (Aug 10, 2021), median follow-up was 14·9 months (IQR 8·8-17·0). All patients received study treatment and underwent surgical resection; there were no treatment-related surgical delays. All 34 patients had an R0 resection (>1 mm resection margin). 15 of 17 patients (88% [95% CI 64-99]) in the toripalimab plus celecoxib group and 11 of 17 patients (65% [38-86]) in the toripalimab monotherapy group had a pathological complete response. All patients continued to receive adjuvant toripalimab with or without celecoxib for a total perioperative duration of 6 months and were alive and free of recurrence at data cutoff. During neoadjuvant treatment, ten (59%) patients in the toripalimab plus celecoxib group and ten (59%) in the toripalimab monotherapy group had grade 1-2 treatment-related adverse events. Only one (3%) of 34 patients, who was in the toripalimab plus celecoxib group, had a grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse event during the neoadjuvant phase, which was grade 3 increased aspartate aminotransferase levels. In the adjuvant phase, only one (3%) of 34 patients, who was in the toripalimab monotherapy group, had a grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events, which was grade 3 increased aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels. INTERPRETATION: Neoadjuvant toripalimab with or without celecoxib could be a potential therapeutic option for patients with mismatch repair deficient or microsatellite instability-high, locally advanced, colorectal cancer. This treatment was associated with a high pathological complete response rate and an acceptable safety profile, which did not compromise surgery. Longer term follow-up is needed to assess effects on survival-related endpoints.

37739646,2023,A multi-national survey of experience and attitudes towards managing catheter related blood stream infections for home parenteral nutrition. ,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) is the most common complication of home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in patients with chronic intestinal failure (CIF). The aim of this study was to assess the broad range of practices of international multi-disciplinary teams involved in the care of this complication occurring in CIF patients. DESIGN: An online questionnaire was designed and distributed to members of the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) and distributed to colleagues involved in managing patients with CIF. RESULTS: A total of 47 responses were included from centers across 21 countries. The centers had been delivering HPN for a median 21 years (IQR 11-35) and were actively following a median 58 patients (27-120) per center for benign CIF in 80% of cases (67-95). Tunneled catheters were the most common type of central venous catheters (CVC), representing 70% (47-86) of all CVC in use. For the management of CRBSI, written procedures were provided in 87% of centers. First measures included simultaneous central and peripheral blood cultures (90%), stopping HPN infusion (74%), and administrating an antibiotic lock and systemic antibiotics (44%). Immediate removal of the CVC was more likely in case of fungal infection (78%), Staphylococcus aureus (53%), or in case of PICC catheter (52%) (all p < 0.01). After the first CRBSI, 80% of centers used preventive CVC locks (taurolidine in 84% of cases, p < 0.001). We observed a large heterogeneity in practices regarding preparation, duration, reaspiration, and volume of CVC locks, and monitoring of CRBSI (timing of blood cultures, radiological work-up). CONCLUSION: In this international survey of HPN expert centers, we observed a significant consensus regarding the initial management of CRBSI and the use of secondary preventive CVC locks, while areas of variation exist. Management of CRBSI may be improved with clearer recommendations based on the micro-organism and the type of CVC, including PICC lines which are increasingly used yet insufficiently studied in HPN patients.

This retrospective study evaluates the occurrence of catheter occlusion of PICCs constructed of a poly(vinyl alcohol)-based hydrogel composite known as hydrophilic biomaterial (HBM), compared to thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) control devices. A total of 121 PICCs, 60 HBM and 61 TPU, were placed in patients with a clinical need and were reviewed for the occurrence of catheter occlusion. The records review found that occlusions occurred in 0/60 (0.0%) of the HBM PICCs and 13/61 (21.3%) of TPU PICCs (p = 0.001). HBM exhibits favorable qualities for vascular access, most importantly its extreme hydrophilicity. Clinically, this may be responsible for the reduction in PICC occlusions, which could improve patient outcomes. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Humans' 'Retrospective Studies'

36269668,2022,Quality Improvement Report: Safety Program for Prevention of Central Line-associated Bloodstream Infections. ,"The increasing usage of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in medical imaging departments has led to a corresponding increase in cases of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). However, this condition is preventable with proper monitoring and use of aseptic techniques. A Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (CUSP) is a quality improvement (QI) measure implemented by health care institutions to reduce the incidence of CLABSI. However, effective strategies have yet to be established. The authors describe a QI project that evaluated the implementation of CUSP at a teaching hospital to reduce PICC-associated bloodstream infection (BSI). The framework consists of a five-step process: understand and train staff on the science of safety, assemble a team, engage senior executives, identify defects through sensemaking, and implement teamwork and communication strategies in a series of related and sequential steps that use QI tools. Targets were identified for improvement from existing processes, and the workflow was reengineered. Nine months after the start of the CUSP intervention, PICC-associated BSI incidence in the hospital had been reduced from 3.4 to 2.7 per 1000 central lines days after intervention. The incidence of BSI was also reduced correspondingly from 8.8% to 5.9%. The QI processes in this study may be adopted by other hospitals, as they involve minimal cost with significant impact on patient safety and well-being. The QI sequential steps described capture the implementation processes that can be modified for use in other department settings where patient safety could be compromised.

Multiple devices such as peripherally inserted central venous catheters, tunneled central venous catheters (eg, Hohn catheter, Hickman catheter, C. R. Bard, Inc, Salt Lake City UT), and implantable ports are available for this purpose. The device selected for central venous access depends on the clinical indication, duration of the treatment, and associated comorbidities. It is important for health care providers to familiarize themselves with the types of central venous catheters available, including information about their indications, contraindications, and potential complications, especially the management of catheters in the setting of catheter-related bloodstream infections. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios.

27908432,2016,Safety and utilization of peripherally inserted central catheters versus midline catheters at a large academic medical center. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are a commonly used central intravenous (IV) access device, which can be associated with significant complications. Midline catheters (MCs) are peripheral IV access devices that may reduce the need for central lines and hence decrease central line-associated bloodstream infections. The objective of this study is to compare the utilization and safety of PICCs and MCs. METHODS: This was a retrospective study comparing the use and outcomes of PICCs and MCs at a large academic medical center between January and May 2015. Data were collected using electronic medical records and IV team insertion data. Statistical software was used for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 206 PICCs and 200 MCs were inserted in 367 patients within the study duration. Patients with MCs were more likely to have complications than those with PICCs (19.5% vs 5.8%, P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: MCs were associated with a higher risk of non-life-threatening complications versus PICCs, which showed fewer but more serious complications, including bacteremia. The decision to move toward more use of MCs is not without risk. Institutions should continue to review the utilization and safety data of IV catheter use to determine the most appropriate use of these devices.

33030308,2021,"Current status on microsatellite instability, prognosis and adjuvant therapy in colon cancer: A nationwide survey of medical oncologists, colorectal surgeons and gastrointestinal pathologists. ","BACKGROUND: There is significant variation in attitude both towards the role of microsatellite instability (MSI) in predicting prognosis, and towards its role in guiding which Stage II colon cancer patients may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. AIM: To examine the current status of specialist attitudes towards MSI in guiding prognosis and adjuvant therapy in stage II colon cancer. METHODS: The Pathology in Colon Cancer, Prognosis and Uptake of Adjuvant Therapy (PiCC UP) Australia and New Zealand questionnaire was distributed to colorectal surgeons, medical oncologists and pathologists after institutional board approval. A 5-scale Likert score was used to assess attitudes towards 23 pathological features for prognosis and 18 features for adjuvant therapy. Data were analysed using a rating scale and graded response model in item response theory (IRT) on STATA (Stata MP, version 15; StataCorp LP). RESULTS: 164 specialists (45 oncologists, 86 surgeons and 33 pathologists) participated. 80.5% regularly attended colorectal multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings. 89.63% and 59.26% of specialists reported that MSI status was likely or definitely to influence prognosis in colon cancer and recommendations for adjuvant therapy in Stage II colon cancer respectively. IRT modelling was achieved in 17 pathological features for prognosis. MSI IRT score was 4.47 (95% CI: 4.05-4.68). IRT modelling was achieved in 10 pathological features for adjuvant therapy. MSI IRT score was 3.62 (2.89-4.15). MSI ranked 10 (of 17) in order of importance in determining prognosis and ranked three (of 10) in guiding adjuvant therapy. CONCLUSION: MSI status is considered an important biomarker when selecting patients for adjuvant therapy in Stage II colon cancer. MSI is also considered useful in prognostication of colon cancer. MSI status was ranked similar to the tumour grade of differentiation and the presence of perineural invasion.

32205131,2020,Patterns and risk factors of peripherally inserted central venous catheter-related symptomatic thrombosis events in patients with malignant tumors receiving chemotherapy. ,"OBJECTIVE: Peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC)-related thrombosis (PRT) is a serious complication that can lead to interruptions in chemotherapy and other supportive care, as well as increased hospital stay and costs. We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the patterns of symptomatic PRT in patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy and their risk factors. METHODS: A retrospective study of 938 PICC patients from our institution between November 2014 and July 2017 was performed. Symptomatic PRT events were confirmed by color Doppler ultrasonography or computed tomography pulmonary angiography in the presence of clinical symptoms. The variables of interest were extracted from the electronic medical record system. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk factors for PRT. RESULTS: Of the 938 patients who were followed up for more than 120,000 patient-days, 63 patients (6.7%; 0.51 per 1000 catheter-days) had symptomatic PRT. Sixty-one patients were diagnosed with upper extremity venous thrombosis (UEVT), of which 18 were isolated superficial vein thrombosis (SVT), 19 were isolated deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and 24 were extensive venous thrombosis (EVT). Two patients were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism, and two patients were diagnosed with UEVT with pulmonary embolism. The symptomatic SVT occurred in 42 of 938 patients with cancer (4.5%), which accounted for 68.9% of all UEVT events. The median time to PRT was 21 days, and the median time to catheter removal in the PRT group was 66 days as compared with 117 days in the no PRT group. Predictors associated with increased risk of PRT were age >60 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.142; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.118-4.103) and a chemotherapy regimen containing fluorouracil (OR, 2.429; 95% CI, 1.013-5.825). Hypertension with medication was a protective factor for PRT (OR, 0.306; 95% CI, 0.113-0.828). Among the 28 patients who did not remove their PICCs immediately after PRT was diagnosed, patients with SVT, DVT, and EVT had similar success rates of retaining catheters in situ after anticoagulant therapy (SVT, 83.3%; DVT, 62.5%; EVT, 75.0%; P = .667). CONCLUSIONS: Age >60 years and chemotherapy regimens containing fluorouracil were independent risk factors for PRT and hypertension with medication was associated with a lower risk of PRT in patients with cancer with PICCs receiving chemotherapy. PICCs-related SVT was a frequent type of PRT, which might need a better understanding and anticoagulant therapy in patients with cancer with PICCs.

Patients included in this study and diagnosed with basal ganglia hemorrhage were admitted between January 2017 and December 2019. RESULTS: Univariate analysis discovered some personal risk factors including gender (p = .002), age (p = .023), and underlying conditions such as diabetes (p = .036), coronary heart disease (p = .009), and renal insufficiency (p = .001). Invasive medical operations including endotracheal intubation, tracheotomy, ventilator use, lumbar puncture, urinary catheter insertion, and peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) (p < .001 all) were also risk factors for HAP. Binary logistics regression indicated hospital duration, antibiotic exposure, and urinary catheter insertion explained 91.4% of the variance on HAP (p < 0.01). As for the antibiotic treatment, there were no difference in the duration of use days and total dose per patient between MDR and non-MDR group, except for Tigecycline. Antibiotic costs for the MDR group were significantly higher than those for the non-MDR group and no infection group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: To better prevent HAP particularly caused by MDR bacteria, we emphasize the aseptic technique especially in the management of equipment in patient care.

27467651,2016,Clinical evaluation of a securement device used on midline catheters. ,"Since the introduction of sutureless securement products for vascular access devices (VADs), there has been a great deal of discussion of their advantages and disadvantages in comparison with sutures. This includes questions related to VAD securement, patients' comfort, infection control, user-friendliness and potential complications of using the device. The literature review of the available evidence indicates the superiority of the novel sutureless devices in the aforementioned aspects. The authors collected data to further contribute in the analysis of the attributes of these products, namely Statlock™ and Grip-Lok™ (current devices). The authors then trialled, collected and analysed data from relevant healthcare practitioners on their perception of a novel sutureless 3M™ Tegaderm™ PICC/CVC Securement Device + Tegaderm™ I.V. Advanced Securement Dressing (trialled device) for midline VADs. Evaluation forms have been provided and filled in by the practitioners. The results showed that the trialled product is perceived as user-and patient-friendly, resulting in increased security of VAD and easier handling compared to the current devices. Overall, 70% of the evaluators stated that the trialled product has better or much better overall performance. The remaining 30% characterised the overall performance comparable with the current devices. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Attitude of Health Personnel' '*Bandages'

36751645,2023,Comparing Complication Rates of Midline Catheter vs Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter. A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) and midlines are commonly used devices for reliable vascular access. Infection and thrombosis are the main adverse effects of these catheters. We aimed to evaluate the relative risk of complications from midlines and PICCs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. The primary outcomes were catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) and thrombosis. Secondary outcomes evaluated included mortality, failure to complete therapy, catheter occlusion, phlebitis, and catheter fracture. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: Of 8368 citations identified, 20 studies met the eligibility criteria, including 1 RCT and 19 observational studies. Midline use was associated with fewer patients with CRBSI compared with PICCs (odds ratio [OR], 0.24; 95% CI, 0.15-0.38). This association was not observed when we evaluated risk per catheter. No significant association was found between catheters when evaluating risk of localized thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. A subgroup analysis based on location of thrombosis showed higher rates of superficial venous thrombosis in patients using midlines (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.48-3.57). We did not identify any significant difference between midlines and PICCs for the secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that patients who use midlines might experience fewer CRBSIs than those who use PICCs. However, the use of midline catheters was associated with greater risk of superficial vein thrombosis. These findings can help guide future cost-benefit analyses and direct comparative RCTs to further characterize the efficacy and risks of PICCs vs midline catheters.

33845675,2022,Reverse tapered versus non-tapered peripherally inserted central catheters: A narrative review. ,"Introduced over 20 years ago, the reverse tapering design for PICC catheters is supposed to have some benefits in terms of both efficacy and safety. In particular, it would ensure less postoperative bleeding at the exit site and greater effectiveness in preventing kinking or twisting of the same. Since its introduction, these hypothesized advantages have never been demonstrated in clinical studies, however very scarce, which have highlighted neither advantages nor disadvantages of reverse tapered catheters when compared to non-reverse tapered ones. This narrative review analyzes some aspects of the use of reverse tapered PICCs, also paying attention to some possible undesirable effects that have arisen from the introduction into clinical practice of new subcutaneous systems of securement of PICCs to the skin. Clinicians should be aware of the fact that reverse tapering design does not represents a sure improvement in terms of safety and efficacy of PICCs and its adoption should be weighed against possible clinical disadvantages.

33356810,2022,Impact assessment following implementation of a vascular access team. ,"BACKGROUND: A vascular access team (VAT) was created in 2018 with the aim of improving vascular access and reducing complications associated with catheters. The impact of the introduction of a VAT in the insertion and maintenance of peripheral insertion central catheters (PICCs) was assessed. The cost-benefit associated with the use of a VAT was evaluated and the satisfaction of patients and professionals interacting with the VAT was measured. METHODS: In a prospective study, 275 PICCs inserted by the VAT were assessed for their impact on complications. PICCs were implanted with maximum barrier measures using an ultrasound with IC-ECG. Also, patient and professional satisfaction have been analysed thought a questionnaire over the phone or online, and hospital financial data was used to assess the cost impact of the insertion methodology followed by the VAT versus Anaesthesia Service. RESULTS: The thrombosis rate was 2.5% (7) and the bacteraemia rate was 1.1% (3). The use of the IC-ECG was correlated with a lower complication than the RX + IC-ECG (OR = 3.28, p = 0.021). In addition, there was a high level of perceived satisfaction for the patients surveyed and for the healthcare professionals involved in the care and management of these devices. The calculated saving for the implementation of the VAT was 61.81% compared with PICCs implanted in Anaesthesia Service. CONCLUSION: Low complication rates and high overall satisfaction scores in patients and professionals were observed, showing that a specialist VAT can have a positive impact in the insertion of PICCs and which also has a clear economic benefit.

27792437,2016,Preventing intraluminal occlusion in peripherally inserted central catheters. ,"Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are used in a variety of specialties. Infective and thrombotic complications are widely reported but little has been written about the complications of persistent withdrawal occlusion (PWO) or complete luminal occlusion in PICCs. An audit was conducted of all patients who had a PICC in situ for a 6-week period, using a combination of reviewing clinical documentation and local departmental databases, physical review of inpatients and discussion with the relevant clinical nurse specialists in haematology, oncology, outpatient antibiotic therapy and the vascular access team, to determine the degree of PWO or occlusion but also to review possible financial implications in the introduction of a more expensive product. It was difficult to determine a rate for either PWO or complete occlusion owing to the diversity of the patient cohort and the tertiary nature of the organisation; the occlusion rate was estimated at 5%, but there was general agreement this was underestimating the problem. A needle-free connector was subsequently introduced for all PICCs in haematology, oncology and hepatobiliary services. Following the change in needle-free connector, 180 PICCs were inserted by the vascular access team on one of the organisation's sites over a 12-month period, with a total dwell time of 9702 catheter days (mean: 53.9 days, median: 35 days), a PWO rate of 1/1000 catheter days and total occlusion rate of 0.4/1000 catheter days. The time for insertion to complication of PWO or occlusion ranged from 9 to 144 days. Despite poor baseline data the results suggested the introduction of the bi-directional needle-less connector had a positive impact on the PWO and occlusion rates in PICCs.

A review was performed to illustrate the response of surgical staff during the pandemic with regard to patient care and residency training. METHODS: The evaluation and assessment of the changes enacted at Stony Brook Medicine's Department of Surgery is illustrated through the unique perspective of surgical residents. No IRB approval or written consent was obtained nor it was necessary for the purposes of this paper. RESULTS: Hospital policy was enacted to hinder transmission of COVID-19 and included limited gatherings of people, restricted travel, quarantined symptomatic staff, and careful surveillance for disease incidence. Surgical residency transformed as residents were diverted from traditional surgical services to staff new COVID-19 ICUs. Education transitioned to an online-based platform for lectures and reviews. New skills sets were acquired such as PICC line placement and complex ventilator management.

30513003,2019,Antithrombogenic peripherally inserted central catheters: overview of efficacy and safety. ,"INTRODUCTION: Thrombotic complications associated with peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are common, as most synthetic materials when placed in the presence of serum often result in platelet activation, fibrin deposition, thrombotic occlusion, and potentially embolization. A current innovation focus has been the development of antithrombogenic catheter materials, including hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces. These are being incorporated into PICCs in an attempt to prevent the normal thrombotic cascade leading to patient harm. AREAS COVERED: This review focuses on the laboratory efficacy and clinical effectiveness of antithrombogenic PICCs to prevent PICC-associated thrombosis, as well as their efficiency and safety. This synthesis was informed by a systematic identification of published and unpublished laboratory and clinical studies evaluating these technologies. EXPERT COMMENTARY: A range of PICCs have been developed with antithrombogenic claims, using varying technologies. However, to date, there is no peer-reviewed laboratory research describing the individual PICCs' effectiveness. Despite promising early clinical trials, adequately powered trials to establish efficacy, effectiveness, efficiency, and safety of all of the individual products have not yet been undertaken.

33579176,2022,Peripherally inserted central catheter versus totally implanted venous port for delivering medium- to long-term chemotherapy: A cost-effectiveness analysis based on propensity score matching. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) and totally implanted vascular access ports (PORTs) have been widely used for medium- to long-term chemotherapy. PICCs are associated with lower insertion cost, but higher complication rates than PORTs. However, there is a paucity of cost-effectiveness comparisons between the devices. We aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of PICCs and PORTs for medium- to long-term chemotherapy from catheter insertion to removal. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted based on propensity score matching (PSM) from the hospital perspective. Data were collected from a retrospective cohort study. The total cost outcome comprised insertion, maintenance, removal and complication costs. The effectiveness outcome was the complication-free rate. The primary and supplemental outcomes were cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: A total of 1050 patients (after PSM for 417 patients) were included. The average total cost for 3-6 month ($603.55 ± 78.68 vs $1270.21 ± 128.84), 6-9 month ($731.40 ± 42.97 vs $1414.48 ± 155.43), and 9-12 month ($966.83 ± 53.78 vs $1587.76 ± 160.56) dwell times were all significantly lower for PICCs than for PORTs (p < 0.001). PICCs were associated with significantly lower complication-free rates than PORTs during the 3-6 month (65.22% vs 90.58%, p < 0.001), 6-9 month (53.33% vs 91.80%, p < 0.001), and 9-12 month (44.44% vs 88.46%, p = 0.015) dwell times. Ultimately, PICCs were associated with lower CERs than PORTs for the 3-6 month (928.54 vs 1395.84) and 6-9 month (1380.00 vs 1537.48) but higher CER for the 9-12 month (2197.34 vs 1804.27) dwell times. ICERs were 2564.08 and 1751.49 with dwell times of 3-6 months and 6-9 months, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study provided economic evidence that informs vascular access device choice for medium- to long-term chemotherapy. For 3-9 month dwell times, PICCs were more cost-effective than PORTs. Furthermore, ICERs were applied and the choice was determined by willingness-to-pay. For 9-12 month dwell times, PORTs might be more cost-effective than PICCs, and studies with larger sample size would be needed to verify this finding in the future.

35473711,2022,Successful use of dalbavancin in the treatment of gram positive blood stream infections: a case series. ,"BACKGROUND: Dalbavancin is a semisynthetic antibiotic used as an alternative to vancomycin for skin infections and osteomyelitis. Its long half-life decreases length of hospitalizations. This study analyzes the effectiveness of Dalbavancin for bacteremia and infective endocarditis. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective chart analysis on patients who received Dalbavancin due to being poor candidates for PICC placement, poor candidates for prolonged hospitalization, or who were leaving against medical advice. Their hospitalizations were analyzed and results were compiled using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Our cohort had 22 patients treated with Dalbavancin for bacteremia and 1 for endocarditis. They were treated with IV antibiotics, typically a regimen of at least vancomycin and a cephalosporin, for a median of 6.5 days prior to receiving Dalbavancin. 20 received one dose, while three received two doses. 22 had confirmed culture clearance and one denied repeat culture. There were no reported side effects from the medication, no readmissions for worsened infection, and no deaths from the infection. 15 patients had follow-up visits within 90 days. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, patients responded well. The lack of readmission to the hospital indicates possible outpatient treatment. This would help decrease cost and comorbidities of long-term hospital stays. These positive results are limited by small sample size and treatment of other antibiotics prior to receiving Dalbavancin. Further research is required to accurately estimate the efficacy of Dalbavancin on bloodstream infections and endocarditis, but these results are promising especially for patients who are not candidates for long term hospitalization or outpatient IV access.

24090605,2013,Infections increase the risk of central venous catheter-related thrombosis in adult acute myeloid leukemia. ,"INTRODUCTION: Central venous catheters (CVC) related thrombosis (CRT) represents a well known complication in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) receiving intensive chemotherapy but the efficacy of antithrombotic prophylaxis still remains controversial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 71 consecutive AML patients whose CVC was inserted before each chemotherapy cycle for an overall number of 106 CVC placements. In 47/106 insertions, a prophylaxis with 100 IU/kg/day low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was administered for 7 days after CVC insertion and additional 7 after CVC removal. This unconventional dose of LMWH, although higher than usual, appeared adequate for a short-course approach. LMWH was delivered regardless of the platelet (PLT) count once provided that it should have been maintained above 20 x 10(9)/L by transfusions. RESULTS: Of 106 insertions, we observed 19 (18%) episodes of CRT, 58 (54%) of sepsis and 50 (47%) infections of CVC-exit site with no difference between LMWH and no-LMWH group. Occurrence of CRT was significantly associated with CVC-exit site infections (14/19, p=0.01) and sepsis (16/19, p=0.005) with no difference between LMWH and no-LMWH group. In multivariate analysis, both CVC-exit site infections and sepsis were confirmed to be independent risk factors for CRT development. CONCLUSION: Our retrospective study, although based on a small sample size, suggests that the occurrence of CVC-exit site infections and neutropenic sepsis following chemotherapy significantly increases the risk of CRT in AML, independently from the use of LMWH prophylaxis.

37160191,2023,Complications associated with the use of peripherally inserted central catheters and midline catheters in COVID-19 patients: An observational prospective study. ,"BACKGROUND: Among the many interesting aspects of clinical care during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, vascular access still deserves some attention. Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) and midline catheters (MCs) are venous access devices inserted by ultrasound-guided puncture of veins of the arm, which have been associated with the possibility of minimizing infectious complications in different populations of patients. We have investigated their performance in SARS-CoV-2 patients. METHODS: As the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 is still unclear, we have designed a single-center, prospective observational study enrolling all patients with established diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted to our hospital in the period between October 2020 and April 2021 and who required either a PICC or a MC. RESULTS: We recruited 227 patients. The cumulative incidence of CRBSI was 4.35% (10 cases), that is, 3.5 episodes/1,000 catheter days. Four CRBSI occurred in patients with PICCs (4.5/1,000 catheter days) and 6 in those with MCs (3.2/1,000 catheter days). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that COVID-19 patients may have a more pronounced tendency for the development of catheter-related infections compared to other populations of patients.

29791668,2018,Phlebitis and infiltration: vascular trauma associated with the peripheral venous catheter. ,"OBJECTIVE: to determine the incidence rate and risk factors for the nursing-sensitive indicators phlebitis and infiltration in patients with peripheral venous catheters (PVCs). METHOD: cohort study with 110 patients. Scales were used to assess and document phlebitis and infiltration. Socio-demographic variables, clinical variables related to the PVC, medication and hospitalization variables were collected. Descriptive and inferential analysis and multivariate logistic models were used. RESULTS: the incidence rate of phlebitis and infiltration was respectively 43.2 and 59.7 per 1000 catheter-days. Most PVCs with these vascular traumas were removed in the first 24 hours. Risk factors for phlebitis were: length of hospital stay (p=0.042) and number of catheters inserted (p<0.001); risk factors for infiltration were: piperacillin/tazobactan (p=0.024) and the number of catheters inserted (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: the investigation documented the incidence of nursing-sensitive indicators (phlebitis and infiltration) and revealed new risk factors related to infiltration. It also allowed a reflection on the nursing care necessary to prevent these vascular traumas and on the indications and contraindications of the PVC, supporting the implementation of the PICC as an alternative to PVC.

32375605,2020,Randomized multicenter study on long-term complications of peripherally inserted central catheters positioned by electrocardiographic technique. ,"BACKGROUND: The intracavitary electrocardiogram (IC-ECG) method has been used for the tip location of central venous access devices for the advantage of being safe, accurate and highly cost effective. However, long-term follow-up is rare. This randomized clinical trial aimed to evaluate the long-term complications of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) positioned by the IC-ECG method. METHODS: We randomized 2250 patients who needed PICC placement to either a landmark length estimation supplemented by IC-ECG positioned group (ECG group) or the traditional landmark length estimation alone group (control group) in a 2:1 allocation. Post-procedural chest X-rays were applied to confirm tip position. Follow-up was performed monthly to six months. Standard statistics analyses were performed with the SAS 9.13 software, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: As evaluated by post-procedural chest X-ray, tip location in the ECG group had a first-attempt success (catheter tip located at optimal position) of 91.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 90.3%-93.1%), significantly higher than 78.9% (95% CI: 76.0%-81.9%) observed in the control group (p < 0.001). At six-month follow-up, in the control group, frequency of total complications was 9.5%, including the exit site infection (4.0%), phlebitis (1.3%), deep venous thrombosis (1.5%), liquid extravasation (2.9%) and mechanical failure (1.9%). The IC-ECG group had significantly lower rates of complications (6.4%, p < 0.001), including the exit site infection (2.7%, p > 0.05), phlebitis (1.1%, p > 0.05), deep venous thrombosis (1.2%, p > 0.05), liquid extravasation (2.4%, p > 0.05) and mechanical failure (1.2%, p > 0.05). In the univariable logistic regression analysis, ECG method, other diseases and upper arms were the independent protective factors, and the number of adjustment procedures (n ≥ 2) were the independent risk factors of the complications. CONCLUSIONS: The intra-procedural tip location by IC-ECG is more safe and accurate than the traditional method of verifying tip location only post-procedurally, by chest X-ray.

33515107,2021,Peripherally or centrally inserted central catheters: what is the best vascular access device for cancer patients? ,"Choosing the appropriate vascular access device is a pivotal step to guarantee vessel health and preservation in cancer patients. The first turning point is the determination of the need for central venous catheters (CVCs) followed by the selection of the CVC that will complete the prescribed treatment while minimizing complications and satisfying patients' needs and expectations. Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) have steadily grown over the years as an alternative to centrally inserted central catheters and totally implantable catheters based on several advantages including avoidance of placement-associated mechanical complications, easier transitions from hospital to intermediate care settings and home, but also increase in healthcare expenditure, supportive reimbursement policies, and ability to train existing staff. Notwithstanding PICCs have been perceived for a long time as associated with fewer complications, reduced costs, and higher patients' satisfaction compared to other CVCs, recent evidence has raised concerns about their safety profile without any benefits for longer-term costs neither for patients' satisfaction. This commentary offers a comprehensive overview on PICC-related (1) complications, (2) costs, and (3) patients' satisfaction to help healthcare professionals in the choice of the vascular device during their clinical practice. Based on the most recent literature, we finally suggested that the choice of the CVC should depend on the clinical situation with totally implantable catheters being the preferred device for patients who need intermittent long-term and high-dose chemotherapy, while PICCs may be a better choice for patients who need short-term chemotherapy or continuous short-term supportive therapy.

37114756,2023,"Multinational prospective study of incidence and risk factors for central-line-associated bloodstream infections in 728 intensive care units of 41 Asian, African, Eastern European, Latin American, and Middle Eastern countries over 24 years. ","OBJECTIVE: To identify central-line (CL)-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) incidence and risk factors in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). DESIGN: From July 1, 1998, to February 12, 2022, we conducted a multinational multicenter prospective cohort study using online standardized surveillance system and unified forms. SETTING: The study included 728 ICUs of 286 hospitals in 147 cities in 41 African, Asian, Eastern European, Latin American, and Middle Eastern countries. PATIENTS: In total, 278,241 patients followed during 1,815,043 patient days acquired 3,537 CLABSIs. METHODS: For the CLABSI rate, we used CL days as the denominator and the number of CLABSIs as the numerator. Using multiple logistic regression, outcomes are shown as adjusted odds ratios (aORs). RESULTS: The pooled CLABSI rate was 4.82 CLABSIs per 1,000 CL days, which is significantly higher than that reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network (CDC NHSN). We analyzed 11 variables, and the following variables were independently and significantly associated with CLABSI: length of stay (LOS), risk increasing 3% daily (aOR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.03-1.04; P < .0001), number of CL days, risk increasing 4% per CL day (aOR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03-1.04; P < .0001), surgical hospitalization (aOR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.03-1.21; P < .0001), tracheostomy use (aOR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.23-1.88; P < .0001), hospitalization at a publicly owned facility (aOR, 3.04; 95% CI, 2.31-4.01; P <.0001) or at a teaching hospital (aOR, 2.91; 95% CI, 2.22-3.83; P < .0001), hospitalization in a middle-income country (aOR, 2.41; 95% CI, 2.09-2.77; P < .0001). The ICU type with highest risk was adult oncology (aOR, 4.35; 95% CI, 3.11-6.09; P < .0001), followed by pediatric oncology (aOR, 2.51;95% CI, 1.57-3.99; P < .0001), and pediatric (aOR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.81-3.01; P < .0001). The CL type with the highest risk was internal-jugular (aOR, 3.01; 95% CI, 2.71-3.33; P < .0001), followed by femoral (aOR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.96-2.68; P < .0001). Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) was the CL with the lowest CLABSI risk (aOR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.02-2.18; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: The following CLABSI risk factors are unlikely to change: country income level, facility ownership, hospitalization type, and ICU type. These findings suggest a focus on reducing LOS, CL days, and tracheostomy; using PICC instead of internal-jugular or femoral CL; and implementing evidence-based CLABSI prevention recommendations.

37933329,2023,Myopic (Peri)papillary Changes and Visual Field Defects. ,"PURPOSE: Myopic eyes combining gamma peripapillary atrophy and peripapillary staphyloma were sorted according to the presence of intrachoroidal cavitation (PICCs) or its absence (combinations). Visual field defects (VFDs) and factors discriminating these groups were analyzed. METHODS: These groups were sorted by optical coherence tomography. VFDs were assessed using the Humphrey(®) Field Analyzer 3, SITA standard. Ovality index (OI) was the ratio between the shortest and longest diameters of the disc. The proportions of PICCs, lamina cribrosa defects (LCDs) and clusters in each Garway-Heath's sector (A-F) were analyzed. All variables were compared between PICCs and combinations. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed ultimately. RESULTS: Of the 93 eyes, we obtained, 20 PICCs and 73 combinations. The prevalence of VFDs and LCDs in PICCs were 65% (13/20) and 30% (6/20), respectively. PICCs 85% (17/20) and LCDs 12% (11/93) predominated in sector B (inferotemporal) and clusters 9.7% (9/93) in the corresponding sector. The proportion of VFDs was significantly higher in PICCs than combinations (p < 0.001). In sector B, the proportion of LCDs was significantly higher in PICCs than combinations (p = 0.011). The mean OI was significantly lower (p < 0.001) in PICCs than combinations. Multivariate logistic regression analysis concluded that mean OI (p < 0.001) was the only statistically significant factor discriminating PICCs and combinations. CONCLUSION: Mean OI discriminating PICCs from combinations is further evidence of a gradation of structural changes between them. It could be related to the higher proportion of VFDs in PICCs. The predominant distribution of PICCs infero-temporally supports PICC as a cause of uncertainty in glaucoma diagnosis in high myopia. Furthermore, the highest proportion of PICCs and LCDs in this sector highlights its vulnerability to damage in myopic eyes and deserves further investigation as it is also primarily involved in glaucoma.

37205327,2023,A Novel Risk Assessment Model Predicts Major Bleeding Risk at Admission in Medical Inpatients. ,"BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading cause of preventable hospital death in the US. Guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians and American Society for Hematology recommend providing pharmacological VTE prophylaxis to acutely or critically ill medical patients at acceptable bleeding risk, but there is currently only one validated risk assessment model (RAM) for estimating bleeding risk. We developed a RAM using risk factors at admission and compared it with the International Medical Prevention Registry on Venous Thromboembolism (IMPROVE) model. METHODS: A total of 46,314 medical patients admitted to a Cleveland Clinic Health System hospital from 2017-2020 were included. Data were split into training (70%) and validation (30%) sets with equivalent bleeding event rates in each set. Potential risk factors for major bleeding were identified from the IMPROVE model and literature review. Penalized logistic regression using LASSO was performed on the training set to select and regularize important risk factors for the final model. The validation set was used to assess model calibration and discrimination and compare performance with IMPROVE. Bleeding events and risk factors were confirmed through chart review. RESULTS: The incidence of major in-hospital bleeding was 0.58%. Active peptic ulcer (OR = 5.90), prior bleeding (OR = 4.24), and history of sepsis (OR = 3.29) were the strongest independent risk factors. Other risk factors included age, male sex, decreased platelet count, increased INR, increased PTT, decreased GFR, ICU admission, CVC or PICC placement, active cancer, coagulopathy, and in-hospital antiplatelet drug, steroid, or SSRI use. In the validation set, the Cleveland Clinic Bleeding Model (CCBM) had better discrimination than IMPROVE (0.86 vs. 0.72, p < .001) and, at equivalent sensitivity (54%), categorized fewer patients as high-risk (6.8% vs. 12.1%, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: From a large population of medical inpatients, we developed and validated a RAM to accurately predict bleeding risk at admission. The CCBM may be used in conjunction with VTE risk calculators to decide between mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis for at-risk patients.

30909723,2019,Comparison of Venous Thrombosis Complications in Midlines Versus Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters: Are Midlines the Safer Option? ,"Catheter-related (CR) thrombosis is a significant complication of midline catheters (MCs) and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs). Limited existing data for MCs suggest a favorable complication profile for MCs. To compare incidence of CR thrombosis between MCs and PICCs and to evaluate the impact of quantity of lumens and catheter diameter on CR thrombosis. This was a retrospective comparison spanning 13 months of MCs and PICCs for symptomatic CR thrombosis at an 1100 bed tertiary care academic medical center. Adult patients who had an MC or a PICC placed by the were included. Data were collected using the electronic medical record. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS software. A total of 2577 catheters were included in the analysis with 1094 MCs and 1483 PICCs. One hundred thirty (11.88%) MCs developed CR thrombosis (deep vein thrombosis [DVT] or superficial venous thrombophlebitis [SVT]) as compared to 112 (6.88%) PICCs (odds ratio [OR]: 1.82; P < .0001). Midline catheters had a 53% greater odds of developing CR DVT than PICCs (7.04% MCs and 4.72% PICCs; OR: 1.53; P = .0126). For CR SVT, MCs have a 2.29-fold greater odds of developing CR SVT than PICCs (4.84% MCs and 2.16% PICCs; OR: 2.29; P = .0002). For MCs and PICCs, the incidence of CR thrombosis was 13.50% for double lumen/5F lines and was 6.92% for single lumen/4F lines (OR: 2.10; P = <.0001). Symptomatic CR thrombosis is a serious, life-threatening complication that occurs more frequently in MCs compared to PICCs. Inserters should consider placement of single lumen catheters with the smallest diameter to reduce this risk when a midline is used.

The aim is to describe the clinical and ultrasound features, UE-VT-related diseases, and the prevalence of pulmonary embolism (PE) and associated deaths.All UE-VT patients diagnosed by Doppler-ultrasound in Nantes University Hospital, from January 2015 to December 2017, were included retrospectively. UE-VT suspicion patterns, clinical features, UE-VT topography, and prevalence of PE and death were analyzed.Seven hundred and fifty-five UE-VT were analyzed, including 427 deep thrombosis (UE-DVT) and 328 superficial thrombosis (UE-SVT). In 86.2% (n = 651) UE-VT were related to endovascular devices. Among these thrombosis, one third is in connection with a PICC LINE and one quarter with a peripheral venous line. Forty nine percent (n = 370) of the patients had solid neoplasia or hematological malignancies. An inflammatory or systemic infectious context was found in 40.8% (n = 308) of the cases. The most frequently observed clinical sign at the UE-VT diagnosis was edema (28.6%). Among the UE-SVT it was the presence of an indurated cord (33.2%) and among the UE-DVT the indication of the Doppler-ultrasound was mainly a suspicion of infection on endovascular device (35.1%). In 10.6% (n = 80) of the cases the UE-VT were asymptomatic. The most frequently thrombosed veins were brachial basilic veins (16.7% of all thrombosed segments) followed by jugular (13%) and subclavian (12.3%) veins; 61.3% (n = 463) of UE-VT were in the right upper extremity; 63.3% (n = 478) UE-VT were occlusive. The occurrence of PE is 4% and the death rate is 10.2%, mainly related to the severe comorbidities of patients with UE-VT.UE-VT occurs in particular clinical contexts (hematological malignancies, solid cancers, systemic infections) and in the majority of endovascular devices (86.2%).

However, central vascular access devices are associated with a risk of complications, which may include infection, thrombosis, occlusion, or malposition. The vascular access team of 1 midwestern hospital used a quality improvement initiative to reduce the occurrence of complications associated with PICCs. A secondary aim was to reduce the number of alteplase (Cathflo Activase; Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) doses administered. After reviewing current evidence, the vascular access team employed the Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle to document and implement changes in practice. By using a team initiative to investigate this issue, complication rates decreased and patient satisfaction improved. The thrombosis rate decreased by 67%, occlusions by 75%, and alteplase use by 87%. No infections occurred during this study.

23002096,2013,"Catheter-related complications in cancer patients on home parenteral nutrition: a prospective study of over 51,000 catheter days. ","BACKGROUND: Although home parenteral nutrition (HPN) is often indicated in cancer patients, many physicians are concerned about the risks potentially associated with the use of central venous access devices (VADs) in these patients. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the actual incidence of VAD-related complications in cancer patients on HPN. METHODS: All adult cancer patient candidates for VAD insertion and HPN were enrolled. The incidence of complications associated with 4 types of VADs (peripherally inserted central catheter [PICC], Hohn catheter, tunneled Groshong catheter, and port) was investigated, as well as the most significant risk factors. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-nine VADs in 254 patients were studied, for a total of 51,308 catheter-days. The incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) was low (0.35/1000 catheter-days), particularly for PICCs (0/1000; P < .01 vs Hohn and tunneled catheters) and for ports (0.19/1000; P < .01 vs Hohn and P < .05 vs tunneled catheters). Mechanical complications were uncommon (0.8/1000), as was VAD-related venous thrombosis (0.06/1000). Ultrasound-guided venipuncture was associated with a decreased risk of CRBSI (P < .04) and thrombosis (P < .001). VAD securement using sutureless devices reduced the risk of CRBSI and dislocation (P < .001). Hohn catheters had no advantage over PICCs (higher complication rate and shorter dwell time; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In cancer patients, HPN can be safely carried out with a low incidence of complications. Also, VADs are not equal in terms of complication rates, and strict adherence to meticulous insertion policies may effectively reduce catheter-related complications.

37808511,2023,Making a difference? A retrospective review of peripherally inserted central catheters: A single-center experience in Colombia. ,"INTRODUCTION: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are an effective tool as a medical device in patients who require them. However, it is a procedure that has been associated with multiple complications and possible negative outcomes for the health of the patients. This paper seeks to describe the main complications derived from the insertion and maintenance of peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs), based on the experience of a vascular accesses group in a cardiovascular center in Colombia. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional analytical study of the adult population undergoing PICC insertion at the Fundación Cardioinfantil-Instituto de Cardiología, during the period between 2019 and 2020 by the vascular access program, was performed. RESULTS: The frequency of any registered complication was 15.9% for 2019 and 11.2% for 2020. Bleeding at the procedure site occurred in 15.3% during 2019 and 7.0% in 2020, making it the most frequent complication during the procedure. All the variables of complications associated with infection (bacteremia, phlebitis, and catheter-related infection) showed a decrease in 2020 compared to the previous year. The central line-associated bloodstream infection registered for the year 2019 was 1.94 bacteremia's/1000 catheters-day compared to 0.29 bacteremia's/1000 catheters-day. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a 4.7% reduction in the frequency of any registered complication after the implementation of the vascular access groups. Global and specific complications decreased significantly from 2019 to 2020. Notably, bacteremia, a common post-procedure complication, showed a substantial decrease in frequency compared to national and worldwide literature. It is also been described that complications associated with infection showed a decrease in 2020 compared to 2019. Whether or not all these findings are directly or somewhat related to the results stemming from the vascular access groups still needs further investigation.

METHODS: Prospective follow-up of consecutive PICCs inserted for intravenous (IV) antibiotics in adults with CF or with non-CF bronchiectasis at Cochin Hospital (Paris, France). RESULTS: Between March 2009 and December 2011, 182 PICCs were prescribed in 117 adults (67 CF and 50 non-CF patients). Ultrasound-guided placement of catheter was successful in 174/182 (95.6%) procedures; no insertion complication occurred. The mean ± SD catheter dwell time was 15 ± 9 days. No catheter-associated bloodstream infection occurred; main complications were symptomatic upper limb deep vein thrombosis (2%), catheter obstruction (18%) and persistent pain after catheter insertion (18%). Patients' satisfaction was high and PICC could be used to perform antibiotic courses in most patients. CONCLUSIONS: PICCs were generally safe for performing IV antibiotic courses in patients with CF or non-CF bronchiectasis, but prolonged pain and/or catheter obstruction occurred in approximately 20% of cases.

34515987,2022,"Upper extremity deep venous thrombosis prevalence in the NHS Grampian Medical Ambulatory clinic: diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic considerations in oncology patients. ","INTRODUCTION: Whilst upper extremity deep vein thromboses (UEDVT) account for approximately 5 to 10% of all cases of DVT, rigorous guidelines regarding diagnosis and management of presenting patients remain to be developed. The association of UEDVT with concurrent asymptomatic pulmonary embolism as well as the first presentation of malignancy deems essential rigorous research and clinical guideline development to ensure optimal patient care. METHODS: This retrospective audit study is the first to provide estimates of UEDVT prevalence in the North-East Deanery main hospital centre, Aberdeen Royal Infirmary (ARI). RESULTS: Of the 605 patients attending the ARI Ambulatory Emergency Care (AEC) clinic with clinical suspicion of UEDVT, 38 (6.2%) had a confirmatory diagnosis. Underlying malignancy, presence of PICC line, and cardiovascular co-morbidities were identified as common confounding factors. Subclavian vein with concurrent extension to primarily the cephalic vein thrombosis was identified as the most commonly thrombosed venous territories. Importantly, oncology patients were found to have poorer survival outcomes following an UEDVT, in comparison to patients with other significant co-morbidities (cardiovascular, chronic renal disease, inflammatory bowel disease): HR 5.814 (95%CI 1.15, 29.25), p 0.012. Lastly, genetic associations were drawn between patient genetic status as tested for other co-morbidities and prothrombotic cellular cascades, suggesting rigorous VTE assessment in patients identified with congenital or acquired mutations, namely, in CALR, JAK, MSH 2/6, MYC, and FXN. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study offers the first report of UEDVT presentations in the UK with no restrictions of patient performance status or underlying co-morbidities and provides a rounded clinical picture of patient characteristics, diagnosis, management, and prognostic associations in view of rigorous guideline development.

28651885,2017,Use of antibiotic beads to salvage infected breast implants. ,"PURPOSE: When an implant becomes infected, implant salvage is often performed where the implant is removed, capsulectomy is performed, and a new implant is inserted. The patient is discharged with a PICC line and 6-8 weeks of intravenous (IV) antibiotics. This method has variable success and subjects the patient to long-term systemic antibiotics. In the 1960s, the use of antibiotic-impregnated beads for the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis was described. These beads deliver antibiotic directly to the site of the infection, thereby eliminating the complications of systemic IV antibiotics. This study aimed to present a case series illustrating the use of STIMULAN calcium sulfate beads loaded with vancomycin and tobramycin to increase the rate of salvage of the infected implant and forgo IV antibiotics. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of patients who were treated at Mount Sinai Hospital for implant infection with salvage and antibiotic beads. RESULTS: Twelve patients were identified, 10 of whom had breast cancer. Comorbidities included hypertension, smoking, and immunocompromised status. Infections were noted anywhere from 5 days to 8 years postoperatively. Salvage was successful in 9 out of the 12 infected implants using antibiotic bead therapy without home IV antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: The use of antibiotic beads is promising for salvaging infected breast implants without IV antibiotics. Seventy-five percent of the implants were successfully salvaged. Of the three patients who had unsalvageable implants, one was infected with antibiotic-resistant Rhodococcus that was refractory to bead therapy and one was noncompliant with postoperative instructions.

22898795,2013,Role of peripherally inserted central catheters in home parenteral nutrition: a 5-year prospective study. ,"BACKGROUND: Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) has become a common therapy, with tunneled central venous catheters (CVCs) being preferred for its administration. Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are not currently recommended for long-term HPN, although evidence to support this statement is scarce. The authors aimed to evaluate the outcomes of HPN, focusing on CVC-related complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients attended at the authors' center for HPN from 2007-2011 were prospectively included. HPN composition aimed at 20-35 kcal/kg/d, 3-6 g/kg/d of glucose, 1.0 g/kg/d of amino acids, and <1 g/kg/d of lipids. HPN was infused in an intermittent schedule, mostly at night. Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) were confirmed with positive semi-quantitative or quantitative culture of the catheter or simultaneous differential blood cultures drawn through the CVC and peripheral vein. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients received HPN, with 79 implanted CVCs (48 PICCs, 10 Hickman, and 21 ports). Mean catheter-days were 129.1 for PICCs, 98.5 for Hickman, and 67.7 for ports (P = .685). When analyzing CRBSIs, ports had 44, Hickman had 20, and PICC had 0 episodes per 1000 catheter-days (P = .078). Only PICCs showed less incidence of CRBSIs vs ports (P = .043). Multivariate logistic regression, correcting by catheter-days, patients' age and sex, underlying disease, and type of catheter, showed that only catheter-days (P = .031) was a predictor for CRBSIs (P = .007, Nagelkerke R= = 0.246). CONCLUSION: PICCs are similar in terms of catheter-related complications to other CVCs for the administration of HPN, especially for oncology patients with HPN lasting <6 months.

35386293,2022,Clinical Characteristics of Acute Pancreatitis Patients with Multidrug-Resistant Bacterial Infection. ,"BACKGROUND: There are few published reports describing the clinical characteristics of acute pancreatitis (AP) patients with multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infection. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of AP patients with MDRO infection in West China Hospital between July 2015 and June 2020. Basic clinical data, disease progression states, and prognoses of the MDRO and non-MDRO infection groups were compared and analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the related risk factors for MDRO infection. The prognoses of different MDRO infection types were compared. RESULTS: In total, 9812 AP patients were included, 2436 (24.83%) of whom had healthcare-associated infections (641 [26.31%] MDRO infections and 1795 [73.69%] non-MDRO infections). The main MDRO strain was carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) (400/62.40%). The rate of discharge against doctor's advice, mortality, hospitalization expenses, and hospitalization days was higher in the MDRO infection group than in the noninfection group. By logistic regression analysis, the independent risk factors associated with MDRO infection included male sex (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.09~1.70), severity (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.10~1.78), ICU referral (OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.79~3.44), abdominal puncture (OR 2.78, 95% CI 1.93~4.02), fiberoptic bronchoscopy (OR 1.95, CI 1.35~2.81), and PICC/CVC placement (OR 1.48, CI 1.06~2.06). Compared with biliary and hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.73~1.23), alcohol (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.19~0.47) and other etiologies (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41~0.81) conferred a lower risk of MDRO infection. The carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) infection rate was highest in the patients who died. CONCLUSION: The CRAB proportion was highest in AP patients with MDRO infection. MDRO infection is related to many factors, has a poor prognosis, and increases the patient burden. CRKP infection is directly related to poor prognosis.

25198813,2014,"A prospective, randomized comparison of three different types of valved and non-valved peripherally inserted central catheters. ","PURPOSE: Few randomized studies have investigated the impact of valved and non-valved power-injectable peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in terms of incidence of occlusion, infection, malfunction and venous thrombosis. METHODS: We have prospectively compared three types of third-generation polyurethane PICCs. One hundred and eighty adult patients candidate to chemotherapy were randomized into three groups: power-injectable PICCs with Solo-2 proximal valve (Bard); power-injectable PICCs with PASV (Pressure Activated Safety Valve) proximal valve (Navilyst); and non-valved power-injectable PICCs (Medcomp). All PICCs were single lumen 4Fr, inserted according to a well-defined protocol - maximal barrier precautions, ultrasound guidance, intracavitary electrocardiography (IC-ECG), and so on--and managed according to the recommendations of the most recent guidelines (antisepsis with 2% chlorhexidine, transparent dressing, sutureless device, strict 'scrub the hub' policy, neutral displacement needle-free connectors and so on). All catheters were flushed with 10 ml saline before and after each infusion, or with 20 ml saline after blood sampling or infusion of blood products. No heparin was used. RESULTS: We detected no complications at insertion; no PICC-related bloodstream infections; no dislocations; five cases of transient occlusion and two cases of persistent withdrawal occlusion, evenly distributed among the groups; one episode of complete irreversible obstruction (group A); four episodes of asymptomatic peripheral venous thrombosis; one episode of symptomatic, severe central vein thrombosis (group B). In 31% of PICCs in group A (19/61) and in 65% of group B (39/60), difficulties with gravity infusion were reported; three PICCs of group A were complicated by rupture of the intravascular tract during pump infusion. Five PICCs were removed because of complications, four in group A (one obstruction; three ruptures) and one in group B (central venous thrombosis). CONCLUSION: We found no clinical advantages of valved vs. non-valved PICCs.

34980518,2022,Thrombosis and infections of peripherally inserted central catheters in burn patients: A 3-year retrospective study and a systematic review. ,"AIMS: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are becoming common and effective in acute and critical care settings recently. Burn patients need special considerations because of restricted insertion sites, burn wounds, hyper coagulation, high infection rates and others. However, the safety of PICCs in burn patients are not well elucidated and no related protocol has been formed. This study aims to investigate the thrombosis and infections of PICCs in burn patients. METHODS: This was a single center retrospective study and a systematic review. All the burn patients with PICCs between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2020 were included. A systematic search of Medline, PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science was performed from inception to 4 June 2021 following PRISMA guidelines. Upper extremity vein thrombosis (UEVT) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) were the main outcome. RESULTS: A total of 85 successful PICCs in 78 patients were included. Most patients were male (79.5%), adults(80.8%) and injured by flame(74.4%). The mean TBSA was 50.3% and 76.9% of patients had TBSA more than 30%. Most PICCs were punctured once (60.0%) and inserted less than 30 days after injury (80.0%) through basilar vein (70.6%). The overall line days were 2195 days and the mean line days was 25.8 ± 18.3 days. Six PICCs were complicated by UEVT (7.1%) in 21.2 ± 17.3 days after insertion. Patients with UEVT had significantly higher rate of bacteremia and later insertions than those without UEVT. One patient developed CLABSI and the CLABSI rate was 1.2% and 0.5 per 1000 line days. Six PICCs had catheter colonization. No significant risk factors were identified. Five articles involving 293 patients and 319 PICCs were ultimately evaluated in systematic review. The overall incidence of UEVT was 3.2% and CLABSI was 6.9% in burn populations. CONCLUSION: PICCs in burn patients had acceptable incidence of UEVT and CLABSI with relative long line durations. A standardized PICC guideline for burn patients is required to further improve the feasibility and safety of PICCs.

28259730,2017,Incidence of central venous catheter hub contamination. ,"PURPOSE: To investigate microorganisms causing central venous catheter contamination and how this contamination differs across different catheter metrics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After obtaining IRB approval and informed consent, 830 cultures were prospectively obtained from 45 ICU patients with central venous catheter or peripherally inserted central catheter. Bacterial colonies were identified by mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Bacterial contamination of central catheter hubs occurred 44% of the time in this study in the ICU setting. Coagulase-positive staphylococci cultures had higher median (±interquartile range) CFUs (12±232) versus coagulase-negative (3±10) and other bacteria (1±3; P<0.001). Bacterial contamination was associated with various metrics. Higher incidence (P<0.05) of coagulase-positive staphylococci cultures was associated with hub-only connections (a ""hub"" being a female connection; 10.9% vs. 7.9% male connections), connections without a manifold (1lumen device that mixes multiple infusions together; 9.7% vs. 0% with manifold); and central venous pressure monitoring connections (25.8% vs. 7.1% without). Internal jugular sites (10.0% vs. 2.7% femoral, 6.2% PICC, P=0.031) and medial lumens of triple lumen catheters (11.9% vs. 5.6% distal, 7.0% proximal, P=0.049) had increased incidence of higher bacteria loads (>15 CFUs). CONCLUSIONS: This study found a high incidence of central access catheter hub bacterial contamination, which correlated with positive blood cultures in 2 of 3 total bacteremia cases identified in the 45 patients.

24103730,2014,"The safety and efficacy of midlines compared to peripherally inserted central catheters for adult cystic fibrosis patients: a retrospective, observational study. ","BACKGROUND: Intravenous antibiotics are the cornerstone of treatment for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Midlines are a type of vascular access device (VAD) used exclusively in one treatment facility within Australia, most other centres use peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs). OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the safety and efficacy of midlines for CF patients receiving intravenous antibiotics. DESIGN: Retrospective observational. SETTING: A large, major metropolitan teaching hospital in Adelaide, South Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with a diagnosis of CF, who had a PICC or midline inserted for the commencement of antibiotic therapy during the period 2004-2010 to treat a respiratory exacerbation. METHODS: Medical records and hospital reports were used to record rates of adverse events and unexpected removal of VADs. The primary outcome was a composite measure of adverse events (catheter-related blood stream infection, deep vein thrombosis, occlusion, pain, infiltration, bleeding, phlebitis, catheter leakage and dislodgement) and whether the VAD was removed unexpectedly. RESULTS: There were 231 midlines and 97 PICCs inserted into 64 patients (39 male and 25 female; age range 18-47 years old). Presented as per 1000 VAD days, patients with PICCs and midlines had similar rates of adverse events (14 and 11 adverse events per 1000 VAD days, respectively). Unexpected removal was higher for patients with midlines (6.90 per 1000 VAD days) than for PICCs (2.89 per 1000 VAD days). Incident rate ratios (IRRs) showed that patients with midlines and PICCs had similar rates of adverse events (IRR 1.18, P=0.617, CI 0.62-2.22) although the removal rate of patients with midlines was twice that of patients with PICCs (IRR 2.24, P=0.079, CI 0.91-5.56). As an absolute risk there were only 4.09 more cases of removal for patients with midlines per 1000 VAD days than those with PICCs. CONCLUSIONS: Midlines may be an alternative to PICCs for adult CF patients although further research is required with a larger sample size to enable definitive conclusions.

30391696,2019,"Infectious complications in home parenteral nutrition: A long-term study with peripherally inserted central catheters, tunneled catheters, and ports. ","OBJECTIVE: Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) has become a common therapy, with tunneled central venous catheters (CVCs) being the preferred route of administration. Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) have been used increasingly, but whether they should be preferred over other types of CVCs is still controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate catheter-related complications of CVC in patients receiving HPN. METHODS: All patients treated at our center for HPN from 2007 to 2017 were prospectively included. A specialized intravenous therapy team took care of these patients. Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) were confirmed with positive, simultaneous, differential blood cultures drawn through the CVC and peripheral vein and then semiquantitative or quantitative culture of the catheter tip. RESULTS: In all, 151 patients received HPN during the 11-y study period. Of these patients, 95 were women (63%) and 55 were men (37%), with a mean age of 58 ± 13 y. Twenty-six were non-cancer patients (17%) and the remaining 125 patients had an underlying malignancy (83%). Regarding the CVC, 116 were PICCs, 18 Hickman, and 36 ports. Confirmed CRBSI per catheter-days showed 0.15 episodes per 1000 catheter-days for PICCs, 0.72 for Hickman, and 2.02 for ports. PICCs had less-confirmed CRBSIs per 1000 catheter-days than ports (φ = 0.54, P = 0.005), but no difference between PICCs and Hickman was found (φ = 0.32, P = 0.110). Confirmed episodes of CRBSI (2 versus 13%, χ(2) = 6.625, P = 0.036) were more frequent with multilumen catheters. CONCLUSIONS: In our setting, single-lumen PICC and Hickman catheters showed low infectious complications.

37576517,2023,"Clinical Characteristics, Drug Resistance, and Risk Factors for Death of Klebsiella pneumoniae Infection in Patients with Acute Pancreatitis: A Single-Center Retrospective Study from China. ","OBJECTIVE: Infection is a common complication of acute pancreatitis (AP). Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) is one of the most common pathogens associated with nosocomial infections. Our study focuses on investigating the clinical characteristics and risk factors for death of Klebsiella pneumoniae infections in AP patients, further to quantify the prognosis of the patients, and provide evidence for guiding antibiotic use and improving prognosis. METHODS: The data of epidemiology, clinical manifestations and drug resistance rate with K. pneumoniae infections in AP patients from January 1, 2012 to August 30, 2022 were retrospectively collected. Logistic regression model and Cox regression model were, respectively, used to determine the risk factors for carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) acquisition and death. The nomogram prediction model was built by RMS software package to predict the 90-day survival rate. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-six AP patients combined with K. pneumoniae infections, with a mortality rate of 34.9%. The most common infection sites were pancreas and peri-pancreas (54.8%), followed by lung (20.6%) and blood stream (18.3%). The resistance rate of K. pneumoniae to commonly used antibiotics in clinical practice was high, especially CRKP, which was only sensitive to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMZ-TMP) and tigecycline (TGC) (resistance rates were 37.57% and 17.57%, respectively). Independent risk factors for CPKP acquisition were male (OR = 1.655, 95% CI 0.642-4.265, P = 0.017) and PICC/CVC implantation (OR = 3.157, 95% CI 1.223-8.147, P = 0.021). Independent risk factors for mortality included carbapenem resistance (HR = 2.556, 95% CI 1.011-6.462, P = 0.047), hemorrhage (HR = 2.392, 95% CI 1.104-5.182, P = 0.027), septic shock (HR = 3.022, 95% CI 1.312-6.959, P = 0.009), age >60 years (HR = 2.977, 95% CI 1.303-6.799, P = 0.01), creatinine >177μmol/L (HR = 2.815, 95% CI 1.075-7.369, P = 0.035).

33298237,2021,Five-year outcome of peripherally inserted central catheters in adults: a separated infectious and thrombotic complications analysis. ,"OBJECTIVE: To assess infectious and thrombotic complications of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in adults. DESIGN: A 5-year prospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary-care teaching hospital in Seville, Spain. PATIENTS: Adult patients undergoing PICC insertion. METHODS: Catheter-associated bloodstream infection (CABSI) including catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), primary bacteremia (PB), and upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT) were recorded. Independent predictors of complications were assessed by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: In total, 1,142 PICCs were inserted, with 153,191 catheter days (median, 79). Complications included 66 cases of CABSI (5.78%; 0.43‰ catheter days), 38 cases of CRBSI (3.33%; 0.25‰ catheter days), 28 cases of PB (2.45%; 0.18‰ catheter days), and 23 cases of UEDVT (2.01%; 0.15‰ catheter days). The median times to infection were 24, 41, and 60 days for CRBSI, PB, and UEDVT, respectively. Parenteral nutrition (odds ratio [OR], 3.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.77-6.52) and admission to the hematology ward (OR, 4.90; 95% CI, 2.25-10.71) were independently associated with CRBSI and PB, respectively. Admission to the hematology ward (OR, 12.46; 95% CI, 2.49-62.50) or to the oncology ward (OR, 7.89; 95% CI, 1.77-35.16) was independently associated with UEDVT. The crude mortality rate was 24.8%. Only 2 patients died of complications. CONCLUSIONS: PICCs showed a low rate of thrombotic and infectious complications. Compared to PB, CRBSI showed significantly different risk factors, a higher incidence density per catheter days, and a shorter median time to infection. Separate analyses of CRBSI and PB are more specific and clinically useful when analyzing infectious complications. ",['eng'],['Journal Article'],"['Adult' '*Bacteremia/epidemiology/etiology'

30719089,2019,Evaluation of Skin Colonisation And Placement of vascular access device Exit sites (ESCAPE Study). ,"BACKGROUND: Skin microorganisms may contribute to the development of vascular access device (VAD) infections. Baseline skin microorganism type and quantity vary between body sites, yet there is little evidence to inform choice of VAD site selection. OBJECTIVE: To compare microorganisms present at different body sites used for VAD insertions and understand the effect of transparent dressings on skin microflora. METHODS: The ESCAPE observational study consisted of three phases: (1) skin swabs of four sites (mid-neck, base neck, chest, upper arm) from 48 hospital patients; (2) skin swabs of five body sites (mid-neck, base neck, chest, upper arm, lower arm) from 10 healthy volunteers; and (3) paired skin swabs (n = 72) under and outside of transparent dressings from 36 hospital patients (16 mid/base neck, 10 chest, upper arm). Specimens were cultured for 72 h, species identified and colony-forming units (CFU) counted. Ordinal logistic regression compared CFU categories between variables of interest. RESULTS: The chest and upper arm were significantly associated with fewer microorganisms compared to neck or forearm (odds ratio [OR] = 0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.25-0.65, P < 0.05). CFU levels under transparent dressings were not significantly different from outside (OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.22-1.45). Staphylococci were predominant at all sites. Other significant (P < 0.05) predictors of higher CFU count included prolonged hospitalisation and medical/surgical patient status. DISCUSSION: Skin microorganism load was significantly lower at the upper arm or chest, compared to the mid- or base neck. This may impact VAD site selection and subsequent infection risk.

25852128,2016,Environmental Risk Factors for Developing Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infection in Home Parenteral Nutrition Patients: A 6-Year Follow-up Study. ,"BACKGROUND: Tunneled, cuffed, central venous catheters, including Hickman catheters and peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs), are the most commonly used venous access for home parenteral nutrition (HPN) therapy. Catheter-related bloodstream infection is the most prevalent and severe complication. This study investigated whether environmental risk factors, including smoking, catheter management by a home care nurse, colectomy with stoma, number of infusion days per week, and C-reactive protein at catheter insertion day, influenced the time to first catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this 6-year (2008-2014) observational cohort study, adult patients with intestinal failure receiving HPN through either Hickman catheters or PICCs were included. Data were obtained by reviewing medical records, and the environmental risk factors were analyzed with the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: A total of 295 catheters (Hickman catheters: n = 169 and PICCs: n = 126) inserted into 136 patients were registered. Using the PICCs, 1 additional infusion day per week showed to significantly decrease the time to first CRBSI by a factor of 2.47. Hickman catheters managed by a home care nurse had a significantly increased mean (SD) incidence of CRBSI of 1.45 (0.68) per 1000 catheter days. Hickman catheters not managed by a home care nurse had a mean (SD) incidence of 0.56 (0.24). CONCLUSION: Using the PICC, 1 additional infusion day per week decreased the time to first CRBSI, while having the Hickman catheter managed by a home care nurse increased the mean CRBSI incidence.

23710585,2014,Risk factors associated with PICC-related upper extremity venous thrombosis in cancer patients. ,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence and risk factors for peripherally inserted central venous catheters-related upper extremity venous thrombosis in patients with cancer. BACKGROUND: With the widespread use of peripherally inserted central venous catheters, peripherally inserted central venous catheters-related upper extremity venous thrombosis in patients with cancer leads to increasing morbidity and mortality. It is very important to further explore the incidence and risk factors for peripherally inserted central venous catheters-related venous thrombosis. DESIGN AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with cancer who were scheduled to receive peripherally inserted central venous catheters, between September 2009 and May 2012, were prospectively studied in our centre. They were investigated for venous thrombosis by Doppler sonography three times a day within 30 days after catheter insertion. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions' analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for peripherally inserted central venous catheters-related thrombosis. RESULTS: A total of 89 patients with cancer were studied in our research. Of these, 81 patients were followed up within one month. The mean interval between catheter insertion and the onset of thrombosis was 12.45 ± 6.17 days. The multivariable analyses showed that chemotherapy history, less activities and diabetes were the key risk factors for thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Peripherally inserted central venous catheters-related upper extremity venous thrombosis had high incidence rate, and most cases had no significant symptoms. The history of chemotherapy, less activities and diabetes were found to be the key risk factors. It should be routinely scanned in high-risk patients every 3-5 days after catheter insertion, which would then find blood clots in time and reduce the incidence of pulmonary embolism. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Risk factors associated with peripherally inserted central venous catheters-related upper extremity venous thrombosis are of critical importance in improving the quality of patients' life. It is very important to grasp the indications to reduce the incidence rate of peripherally inserted central venous catheters-related upper extremity venous thrombosis.

30838913,2019,Meta-analysis of intracavitary electrocardiogram guidance for peripherally inserted central catheter placement. ,"BACKGROUND: Recently, intracavitary electrocardiogram technology has been applied to peripherally inserted central catheter placement and demonstrates many potential advantages. However, the tip positioning accuracy of intracavitary electrocardiogram technology compared to conventional X-ray method is unknown. OBJECTIVE: We did a meta-analysis to compare the tip positioning accuracy between intracavitary electrocardiogram technology and conventional X-ray method. DATA SOURCES: We searched several databases, including Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of science, and Embase. Additional studies were identified through hand searches of bibliographies and Internet searches. All human studies published in full text, abstract, or poster form were eligible for inclusion. Search terms included peripherally inserted central catheter, PICC, intracavitary electrocardiogram, IC-ECG, EKG, ECG, and catheter tip location. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Only randomized controlled trials of using intracavitary electrocardiogram technology versus X-ray method for peripherally inserted central catheter placement were included. All studies included adult patients aged at least 18 years. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Independent extraction of articles by two authors using predefined data fields, including study quality indicators. Of the 178 citations identified, 5 studies that included 1672 patients met the eligibility criteria. It was found that statistical heterogeneity existed among the various studies (I(2) = 16%, p < 0.00001); therefore, the fixed effect model was used in the meta-analysis (p < 0.05). The meta-analysis compared the tip positioning accuracy between intracavitary electrocardiogram technology and X-ray method and showed that intracavitary electrocardiogram technology had a better positioning accuracy (odds ratio: 2.88, 95% confidence interval: 2.15-3.87, p < 0.0001). LIMITATIONS: Only five randomized trial met inclusion criteria, and the lack of an incomplete search led to the publication bias seen in these results. CONCLUSION: The intracavitary electrocardiogram method had a more favorable positioning accuracy versus traditional X-ray method for peripherally inserted central catheter placement in adult patients. The intracavitary electrocardiogram can be a promising technique to guide tip positioning of peripherally inserted central catheter.

29595367,2018,Lessons learned from the implementation of a medically enhanced residential treatment (MERT) model integrating intravenous antibiotics and residential addiction treatment. ,"BACKGROUND: Hospitalizations for severe infections associated with substance use disorder (SUD) are increasing. People with SUD often remain hospitalized for many weeks instead of completing intravenous antibiotics at home; often, they are denied skilled nursing facility admission. Residential SUD treatment facilities are not equipped to administer intravenous antibiotics. We developed a medically enhanced residential treatment (MERT) model integrating residential SUD treatment and long-term IV antibiotics as part of a broader hospital-based addiction medicine service. MERT had low recruitment and retention, and ended after six months. The goal of this study was to describe the feasibility and acceptability of MERT, to understand implementation factors, and explore lessons learned. METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods evaluation. We included all potentially eligible MERT patients, defined by those needing ≥2 weeks of intravenous antibiotics discharged from February 1 to August 1, 2016. We used chart review to identify diagnoses, antibiotic treatment location, and number of recommended and actual IV antibiotic-days completed. We audio-recorded and transcribed key informant interviews with patients and staff. We conducted an ethnographic analysis of interview transcripts and implementation field notes. RESULTS: Of the 45 patients needing long-term intravenous antibiotics, 18 were ineligible and 20 declined MERT. 7 enrolled in MERT and three completed their recommended intravenous antibiotic course. MERT recruitment barriers included patient ambivalence towards residential treatment, wanting to prioritize physical health needs, and fears of untreated pain in residential. MERT retention barriers included high demands of residential treatment, restrictive practices due to PICC lines, and perceptions by staff and other residents that MERT patients ""stood out"" as ""different."" Despite the challenges, key informants felt MERT was a positive construct. CONCLUSIONS: Though MERT had many possible advantages; it proved more challenging to implement than anticipated. Our lessons may be applicable to future models integrating post-hospital intravenous antibiotics and SUD care. ",['eng'],"['Journal Article' 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural'

35268283,2022,Thromboprophylaxis Reduced Venous Thromboembolism in Sickle Cell Patients with Central Venous Access Devices: A Retrospective Cohort Study. ,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) induces a chronic prothrombotic state. Central venous access devices (CVADs) are commonly used for chronic transfusions and iron chelation in this population. CVADs are an additional venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk factor. The role of thromboprophylaxis in this setting is uncertain. The objectives are: (1) to determine whether thromboprophylaxis reduces VTE risk in SCD patients with CVAD and (2) to explore characteristics associated with VTE risk. We identified adults with SCD and CVAD intended for chronic use (≥3 months) at two comprehensive SCD centers. Thromboprophylaxis presence; type; intensity; and patient-, catheter-, and treatment-related VTE risk factors were recorded. Among 949 patients, 49 had a CVAD (25 without and 24 with VTE prophylaxis). Thromboprophylaxis type and intensity varied widely. Patients without thromboprophylaxis had higher VTE rates (rate ratio (RR) = 4.0 (95% confidence interval: 1.2−12.6), p = 0.02). Hydroxyurea was associated with lower VTE rates (RR = 20.5 (6.4−65.3), p < 0.001). PICC lines and Vortex and Xcela Power implantable devices were associated with higher rates compared with Port-a-Cath (RR = 5.8 (1.3−25.9), p = 0.02, and RR = 58.2 (15.0−225.0), p < 0.001, respectively). Thromboprophylaxis, hydroxyurea, and CVAD subtype were independently associated with VTE. The potentially protective role of thromboprophylaxis and hydroxyurea for VTE prevention in patients with SCD and CVAD merits further exploration.

34289721,2023,Rapid Assessment of Vascular Exit Site and Tunneling Options (RAVESTO): A new decision tool in the management of the complex vascular access patients. ,"In the last decade, different standardized protocols have been developed for a systematic ultrasound venous assessment before central venous catheterization: RaCeVA (Rapid Central Vein Assessment), RaPeVA (Rapid Peripheral Vein Assessment), and RaFeVA (Rapid Femoral Vein Assessment). Such protocols were designed to locate the ideal puncture site to minimize insertion-related complications. Recently, subcutaneous tunneling of non-cuffed central venous access devices at bedside has also grown in acceptance. The main rationale for tunneling is to relocate the exit site based on patient factors and concerns for dislodgement. The tool we describe (RAVESTO-Rapid Assessment of Vascular Exit Site and Tunneling Options) defines the different options of subcutaneous tunneling and their indications in different clinical situations in patients with complex vascular access.

31674857,2020,PICC-PORT totally implantable vascular access device in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. ,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The increasing use of arm totally implantable vascular access devices for breast cancer patients who require chemotherapy has led to a greater risk of complications and failures and, in particular, to upper extremity deep vein thrombosis. This study aims to investigate the outcomes of the arm peripherally inserted central catheter-PORT technique in breast cancer patients. METHODS: The peripherally inserted central catheter-PORT technique is an evolution of the standard arm-totally implantable vascular access device implant based on guided ultrasound venous access in the proximal third of the upper limb with subsequent placement of the reservoir at the middle third of the arm. A prospective study was conducted on 418 adult female breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The primary study outcome was peripherally inserted central catheter-PORT failure. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 215 days. Complications occurred in 29 patients (6.9%) and failure resulting in removal of the device in 11 patients (2.6%). The main complication we observed was upper extremity deep vein thrombosis, 10 (2.4%); all patients were rescued by anticoagulant treatment without peripherally inserted central catheter-PORT removal. The main reason for removal was reservoir pocket infection: 4 (0.9%) with an infection rate of 0.012 per 1000 catheter days. Cumulative 1-year risk of failure was 3.6% (95% confidence interval, 1.3%-7.1%). With regard to the patients' characteristics, body mass index <22.5 was the only significant risk for failure (p = 0.027). CONCLUSION: The peripherally inserted central catheter-PORT is a safe vascular device for chemotherapy delivery that achieves similar clinical results as traditional long-term vascular access devices (peripherally inserted central catheter and arm totally implantable vascular access device, in particular) in breast cancer patients.

34699089,2022,"Characteristics, safety and cost-effectiveness analysis of self-administered outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy via a disposable elastomeric continuous infusion pump at two county hospitals in Houston, Texas, United States. ","WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT) is an attractive option for patients who require parenteral antimicrobials as outpatients. Few OPAT studies have assessed the impact of IV antibiotic therapy via elastomeric continuous pumps, with most having been conducted outside the United States and few in county hospitals. The OPAT program in Harris Health system, the county hospital system of Houston, Texas, United States, has implemented a disposable elastomeric continuous infusion pump (eCIP) for self-administered intravenous antibiotics (s-OPAT) since December 2018. Our goal was to describe the clinical characteristics of patients discharged with an eCIP, as well as the safety and cost-effectiveness of this pump. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed patients discharged from Harris Health hospitals between 12/2018 and 02/2021 with s-OPAT via eCIP at home. We extracted various patient characteristics and outcomes related to OPAT. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Among 481 OPAT patients during the study period, 91 patients received s-OPAT via eCIP. A total of 1925 days of s-OPAT were administered at home, with a median duration of 12 days. Eighty-three patients (93.4%) achieved a cure from infection, six patients (6.6%) had side effects, and nine patients (9.9%) experienced 30-day hospital readmission. Twenty-two patients (24.2%) presented to the ED during s-OPAT, with 13 patients (14.3%) presenting with PICC line concerns. We estimated that s-OPAT via eCIP saved $2,360,500 to $3,503,900 compared to inpatient-only therapy. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Our study showed that patients with s-OPAT via eCIP had a high cure rate with a relatively low incidence of side effects and 30-day hospital readmission. ED visits during therapy were relatively high, which indicates the necessity of close patient monitoring via the OPAT program. eCIP appears to be a good option to facilitate an early disposition of patients in county hospitals.

34399039,2022,D-dimer level for ruling out peripherally inserted central catheter-associated upper extremity deep vein thrombosis and superficial vein thrombosis. ,"AIMS: To examine the effectiveness of D-dimer values to be used as an independent diagnostic marker for excluding peripherally inserted central catheter-associated upper extremity deep vein thrombosis and superficial vein thrombosis. DESIGN: This was a retrospective case-cohort study. METHODS: Records were reviewed for 281 patients who underwent peripherally inserted central catheter insertion between 1 October 2017 and 1 October 2019. According to the modified Wells score after peripherally inserted central catheter insertion, the patients who had low vein thrombosis risk underwent a D-dimer test and colour Doppler ultrasound. RESULTS: Among 281 patients, 180 patients (64%, 95% CI: 58.2%-69.4%) had negative D-dimer results and 39 of 180 patients had vein thrombosis despite having a negative D-dimer result, resulting in a failure rate of 21.7% (95% CI: 16.3%-28.3%). The negative predictive value of peripherally inserted central catheter-associated vein thrombosis in the cancer group (80.0%, 95% CI: 73.2%-85.4%) was higher than that of the non-cancer group (60.0%, 95% CI: 35.7%-80.2%). The negative predictive value of peripherally inserted central catheter-associated deep venous thrombosis (84.9%, 95% CI: 78.7%-89.6%) was lower than that of the PICC-associated superficial venous thrombosis (91.0%, 95% CI: 85.4%-94.6%).

25940453,2015,The Association Between PICC Use and Venous Thromboembolism in Upper and Lower Extremities. ,"BACKGROUND: Peripherally inserted central catheters are associated with upper-extremity deep vein thrombosis. Whether they also are associated with lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism is unknown. We examined the risk of venous thromboembolism in deep veins of the arm, leg, and chest after peripherally inserted central catheter placement. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 76,242 hospitalized medical patients from 48 Michigan hospitals. Peripherally inserted central catheter presence, comorbidities, venous thrombosis risk factors, and thrombotic events within 90 days from hospital admission were ascertained by phone and record review. Cox proportional hazards models were fit to examine the association between peripherally inserted central catheter placement and 90-day hazard of upper- and lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, adjusting for patient-level characteristics and natural clustering within hospitals. RESULTS: A total of 3790 patients received a peripherally inserted central catheter during hospitalization. From hospital admission to 90 days, 876 thromboembolic events (208 upper-extremity deep vein thromboses, 372 lower-extremity deep vein thromboses, and 296 pulmonary emboli) were identified. After risk adjustment, peripherally inserted central catheter use was independently associated with all-cause venous thromboembolism (hazard ratio [HR], 3.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.59-3.85), upper-extremity deep vein thrombosis (HR, 10.49; 95% CI, 7.79-14.11), and lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.02-2.15). Peripherally inserted central catheter use was not associated with pulmonary embolism (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.86-2.06). Results were robust to sensitivity analyses incorporating receipt of pharmacologic prophylaxis during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Peripherally inserted central catheter use is associated with upper- and lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis. Weighing the thrombotic risks conferred by peripherally inserted central catheters against clinical benefits seems necessary. ",['eng'],"['Journal Article' 'Multicenter Study' 'Observational Study'

26075093,2015,Disinfection of Needleless Connector Hubs: Clinical Evidence Systematic Review. ,"Background. Needleless connectors (NC) are used on virtually all intravascular devices, providing an easy access point for infusion connection. Colonization of NC is considered the cause of 50% of postinsertion catheter-related infections. Breaks in aseptic technique, from failure to disinfect, result in contamination and subsequent biofilm formation within NC and catheters increasing the potential for infection of central and peripheral catheters. Methods. This systematic review evaluated 140 studies and 34 abstracts on NC disinfection practices, the impact of hub contamination on infection, and measures of education and compliance. Results. The greatest risk for contamination of the catheter after insertion is the NC with 33-45% contaminated, and compliance with disinfection as low as 10%. The optimal technique or disinfection time has not been identified, although scrubbing with 70% alcohol for 5-60 seconds is recommended. Studies have reported statistically significant results in infection reduction when passive alcohol disinfection caps are used (48-86% reduction). Clinical Implications. It is critical for healthcare facilities and clinicians to take responsibility for compliance with basic principles of asepsis compliance, to involve frontline staff in strategies, to facilitate education that promotes understanding of the consequences of failure, and to comply with the standard of care for hub disinfection.

33983979,2021,Predictive factors of venous recanalization in upper-extremity vein thrombosis. ,"BACKGROUND: Upper extremity venous thrombosis (UEVT) represents about 10% of venous thrombo-embolic disease. This is mainly explained by the increasing use of central venous line, for oncologic or nutritional care. The factors associated with venous recanalization are not known. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate prognosis factor associated with venous recanalization after UEVT. METHODS: This study included patients with UEVT diagnosed with duplex ultra-sonography (DUS) from January 2015 to December 2017 with DUS evaluations during follow-up. A multivariate Cox proportional-hazards-model analysis was performed to identify predictive factors of UEVT complete recanalization. RESULTS: This study included 494 UEVT, 304 proximal UEVT and 190 distal UEVT. The median age was 58 years, 39.5% were women. Clinical context was: hematological malignancy (40.7%), solid cancer (14.2%), infectious or inflammatory context (49.9%) and presence of venous catheters or pacemaker leads in 86.4%. The rate of recanalization without sequelae of UEVT was 38%. For all UEVT, in multivariate analysis, factors associated with complete vein recanalization were: thrombosis associated with central venous catheter (CVC) (HR:2.40, [1.45;3.95], p<0.001), UEVT limited to a venous segment (HR:1.94, [1.26;3.00], p = 0.003), occlusive thrombosis (HR:0.48 [0.34;0.67], p<0.0001), the presence of a PICC Line (HR:2.29, [1.48;3.52], p<0.001), a thrombosis of deep and distal topography (HR:1.70, [1.10;2.63], p = 0.02) or superficial thrombosis of the forearm (HR:2.79, [1.52;5.12], p<0.001). For deep and proximal UEVT, non-occlusive UEVT (HR:2.23, [1.49;3.33], p<0.0001), thrombosis associated with CVC (HR:1.58, [1.01;2.47], p = 0.04) and infectious or inflammatory context (HR:1.63, [1.10;2.41], p = 0.01) were factors associated with complete vein recanalization. CONCLUSION: In this study, factors associated with UEVT recanalization were UEVT limited to a venous segment, thrombosis associated with CVC, a thrombosis of deep and distal thrombosis topography and superficial thrombosis of the forearm. Occlusive thrombosis was associated with the absence of UEVT recanalization.

With many serious infections affecting hospitals, patient scan be fearful. Education and competency processes specific to vascular access devices (VADs) ensure staff have knowledge of the pathophysiology of infection, basic aseptic techniques for cannulation,device management, methods of flushing, assessing device functions,and dressing and securement techniques (Coopersmith et al, 2002;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2011; Infusion Nurses Society (INS), 2011; Pratt et al, 2007). However, knowledge in these areas is often taken for granted and it is assumed that health professionals are applying such knowledge in practice. Staff education is effective in reducing infection and complications (Coopersmith et al, 2002). Through teaching the Clean, Assess and Clear model, which applies to intravenous access, patient assessment and flushing catheters until clear, the basics of safe intravenous care can be consistently understood and applied, and competency assessed (Moureau, 2012).Education on the principles of aseptic technique. is a necessary for all nurses and doctors to establish a culture of safety in all healthcare settings.

37142538,2023,Comparing the use of midline catheters versus peripherally inserted central catheters for patients requiring peripherally compatible therapies: A pilot randomised controlled trial (the compact trial). ,"BACKGROUND: Midline catheter (MC) use has increased in acute-care settings, particularly for patients with difficult venous access or requiring peripherally compatible intravenous therapy for up-to 14 days. Our aim was to assess feasibility and generate clinical data comparing MCs with Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters (PICCs). METHODS: A two-arm parallel group pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT), comparing MCs with PICCs, was conducted in a large tertiary hospital in Queensland between September 2020 and January 2021. The primary outcome was study feasibility, measured against rates of eligibility (>75%), consent (>90%), attrition (<5%); protocol adherence (>90%) and missing data (<5%). The primary clinical outcome was all-cause device failure. RESULTS: In total, 25 patients were recruited. The median patient age was 59-62 years; most patients were overweight/obese, with ≥2 co-morbidities. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: The eligibility and protocol adherence criteria were not met; of 159 screened patients, only 25 (16%) were eligible, and three patients did not receive their allocated intervention post-randomisation (88% adherence). All-cause failure occurred in two patients allocated to MC (20%) and one PICC (8.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that a fully powered RCT testing MCs compared with PICCs is not currently feasible in our setting.

37212331,2023,Device profile of the Orchid safety release valve for the prevention of accidental catheter dislodgement. ,"INTRODUCTION: More than 4 out of 5 patients in acute care require intravenous catheters. Complications of catheter dislodgement and failure are commonly reported at rates of 15-69% causing interrupted treatment and greater resource consumption when catheter replacement is required. AREAS COVERED: This manuscript outlines unmet needs in the prevention of catheter dislodgement and how a novel safety release device (Orchid SRV™, Linear Health Sciences) might address these gaps based on available evidence. EXPERT OPINION: Healthcare initiatives focus on reducing complications and associated costs with the delivery of intravenous treatments. Tension-activated safety release valve devices, attached to intravenous tubing, are a new feature that adds a level of safety to intravenous catheters to reduce mechanical catheter dislodgement when a pull force of greater than 3 pounds is applied. Incorporating a tension-activated accessory into and between existing intravenous tubing and the catheter and extension set protects the catheter from dislodgement. Flow continues until excessive pull force separates and closes the flow pathway in both directions, while the SRV provides a quick replacement to reestablish flow. The safety release valve is used to prevent accidental catheter dislodgement, limit tubing contamination, and avoid more serious complications while maintaining a functional catheter.

METHODOLOGY: In 2019, a voluntary cross-sectional descriptive survey was conducted via SurveyMonkey. Data collected included demographics, practice-oriented information, procedural activities, and supplies used for UGPIV insertions. Frequency distributions and results of Fisher's exact test and one-way analysis of variance were reported using R v.3.5.2. RESULTS: A total of 26,649 surveys were distributed with a response rate of 5.5% (n = 1475). Forty-eight percent of respondents (n = 709) indicated that they worked in a vascular access role, 310 (21%) worked in an ED, and 455 (31%) categorized their role as other. Clinically meaningful differences existed in all variables for UGPIV procedures and supplies between departments (P < 0.0001) and in all care settings. Using an investigatorconstructed overall metric of supplies used, important differences were demonstrated between personnel supply use in vascular access roles and other roles (P < 0.0001) and personnel in EDs and other roles (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Use of supplies for UGPIV insertions varies by department. The variability in supply usage for UGPIV insertions revealed by this survey suggests a need for clinical education on guideline application and evaluation of compliance with policies to promote standardization of supplies for UGPIV insertion.

METHODS: Five databases were systematically searched according to PRISMA guidelines. These databases included Web of Science, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, and Scopus for eligible studies published prior to March 2021. With eligible studies, we conducted a random-effects meta-analysis to evaluate comparative outcomes such as superficial surgical infection, deep surgical infection, seroma incidence, hematoma incidence, and hospital re-admission in patients receiving NPT or standard surgical dressings after hepatopancreatobiliary surgery. RESULTS: The search strategy yielded 963 studies, with six studies meeting inclusion criteria. Odds of superficial surgical site infection (OR: 1.58), deep surgical site infection (1.43), seroma complication (1.64), hematoma complication (0.40) were insignificantly different between patients receiving NPT and standard surgical dressing. The odds of hospital re-admission rate (2.37), however, were elevated in patients receiving standard surgical dressing relative to those receiving NPT. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis shows that NPT usage slightly reduces risk of hospital readmission as compared to standard surgical dressing. We did not observe any significant effect of NPT on superficial, deep surgical infections, seroma, and haematoma outcomes following hepatopancreatobiliary surgery. These findings may aid clinicians in stratifying risk and selecting treatment strategy in patients undergoing hepatopancreatobiliary surgery.

29218697,2018,Quantitative assessment of reflux in commercially available needle-free IV connectors. ,"INTRODUCTION: Blood reflux is caused by changes in pressure within intravascular catheters upon connection or disconnection of a syringe or intravenous tubing from a needle-free connector (NFC). Changes in pressure, differing with each brand of NFC, may result in fluid movement and blood reflux that can contribute to intraluminal catheter occlusions and increase the potential for central-line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI). METHODS: In this study, 14 NFC brands representing each of the four market-categories of NFCs were selected for evaluation of fluid movement occurring during connection and disconnection of a syringe. Study objectives were to 1) theoretically estimate amount of blood reflux volume in microliters (μL) permitted by each NFC based on exact component measurements, and 2) experimentally measure NFC volume of fluid movement for disconnection reflux of negative, neutral and anti-reflux NFC and fluid movement for connection reflux of positive displacement NFC. RESULTS: The results demonstrated fluid movement/reflux volumes of 9.73 μL to 50.34 μL for negative displacement, 3.60 μL to 10.80 μL for neutral displacement, and 0.02 μL to 1.73 μL for pressure-activated anti-reflux NFC. Separate experiment was performed measuring connection reflux of 18.23 μL to 38.83 μL for positive displacement NFC connectors. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed significant differences in reflux volumes for fluid displacement based on NFC design. While more research is needed on effects of blood reflux in catheters and NFCs, results highlight the need to consider NFCs based on performance of individual connector designs, rather than manufacturer designation of positive, negative and neutral marketing categories for NFCs without anti-reflux mechanisms.

35323859,2022,"Home infusion pharmacy quality improvement for central venous access devices using anti-reflux needleless connectors to reduce occlusions, emergency room visits, and alteplase costs. ","PURPOSE: The study's purpose was to measure the impact of anti-reflux needleless connector usage in prevention of intraluminal thrombotic occlusions among central venous catheters, as represented by alteplase usage, in a home infusion patient population. METHODS: An18-month before-and-after cohort study of a single home infusion intervention was conducted to compare occlusion outcomes with use of two types of needleless connectors-neutral and anti-reflux-in preventing catheter occlusions, which have been reported to occur in 28% of home infusion patients, resulting in treatment delays, increased nursing encounters and emergency room visits, and higher overall pharmacy costs for supplies and alteplase. RESULTS: A total of 552,707 patient therapy days were studied: 42.5% in the neutral needleless connector group (n = 235,004 therapy days) and 57.5% in the anti-reflux needleless connector group (n = 317,703 therapy days). The rate of alteplase usage with neutral versus anti-reflux needleless connectors was 4.4% versus 2.2% per 1,000 therapy days, with median alteplase use of 112 (95% CI, 89-169) units versus 82 (95% CI, 68-109) units (P < 0.001). Implementation of anti-reflux connectors reduced occlusions and alteplase usage by 48%. CONCLUSION: Statistical evidence demonstrated that use of anti-reflux needleless connectors with central venous access devices reduced the need for alteplase in the study population. Since 10% of patient occlusions were within 7 days after home infusion admission, future research may indicate that placement of anti-reflux needleless connectors at the time of in-hospital insertion can improve patient outcomes. This quality improvement measure reduced central catheter occlusions, alteplase costs, and the number of required nursing and emergency room visits.

32205954,2020,Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine Position Statement for Central Venous Catheterization and Management 2020. ,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Short-term central venous catheterization (CVC) is one of the commonly used invasive interventions in ICU and other patient-care areas. Practice and management of CVC is not standardized, varies widely, and need appropriate guidance. Purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based and up-to-date, one document source for practice and management of central venous catheterization. These recommendations are intended to be used by critical care physicians and allied professionals involved in care of patients with central venous lines. METHODS: This position statement for central venous catheterization is framed by expert committee members under the aegis of Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine (ISCCM). Experts group exchanged and reviewed the relevant literature. During the final meeting of the experts held at the ISCCM Head Office, a consensus on all the topics was made and the recommendations for final document draft were prepared. The final document was reviewed and accepted by all expert committee members and after a process of peer-review this document is finally accepted as an official ISCCM position paper.Modified grade system was utilized to classify the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations. The draft document thus formulated was reviewed by all committee members; further comments and suggestions were incorporated after discussion, and a final document was prepared. RESULTS: This document makes recommendations about various aspects of resource preparation, infection control, prevention of mechanical complication and surveillance related to short-term central venous catheterization. This document also provides four appendices for ready reference and use at institutional level. CONCLUSION: In this document, committee is able to make 54 different recommendations for various aspects of care, out of which 40 are strong and 14 weak recommendations. Among all of them, 42 recommendations are backed by any level of evidence, however due to paucity of data on 12 clinical questions, a consensus was reached by working committee and practice recommendations given on these topics are based on vast clinical experience of the members of this committee, which makes a useful practice point. Committee recognizes the fact that in event of new emerging evidences this document will require update, and that shall be provided in due time.

33645280,2021,The possible effect of different types of ventilation on reducing operation theatre infections: a meta-analysis. ,"INTRODUCTION: The relation between type of ventilation used in the operating theatre and surgical site infection has drawn considerable attention. It has been reported that there is a possible relationship between the type of ventilation used in the operation theatre and surgical site infection. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate this relationship. METHODS: Through a systematic literature search up to May 2020, 14 studies describing 590,121 operations, 328,183 were performed under laminar airflow ventilation and 2,611,938 were performed under conventional ventilation. Studies were identified that reported relationships between type of ventilation with its different categories and surgical site infection (10 studies were related to surgical site infection in total hip replacement, 7 in total knee arthroplasties and 3 in different abdominal and open vascular surgery). Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated comparing surgical site infection prevalence and type of theatre ventilation using the dichotomous method with a random or fixed-effect model. FINDINGS: No significant difference was found between surgery performed under laminar airflow ventilation and conventional ventilation in total hip replacement (OR 1.23; 95% CI 0.97-1.56, p = 0.09), total knee arthroplasties (OR 1.14; 95% CI 0.62-2.09, p = 0.67) or different abdominal and open vascular surgery (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.43-1.33, p = 0.33). The impact of the type of theatre ventilation may have no influence on surgical site infection as a tool for decreasing its occurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this meta-analysis, operating under laminar airflow or conventional ventilation may have no independent relationship with the risk of surgical site infection. This relationship forces us not to recommend the use of laminar airflow ventilation since it has a much higher cost compared with conventional ventilation.

26349858,2016,Central venous access devices site care practices: an international survey of 34 countries. ,"PURPOSE: Effective postinsertion management of central venous access devices (CVADs) is important to prevent CVAD-associated complications, including catheter-associated bloodstream infections. Although there is a wealth of evidence-based guidelines available to guide the care of CVADs, applying their recommendations to the clinical setting across variable patient groups, CVAD types and international healthcare settings is challenging. This may result in patients receiving suboptimal care. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study using an online survey was performed with an aim to determine current CVAD site care practices internationally. The CVAD site care domains included skin antisepsis, dressing selection, frequency of dressing change and device securement practices across impaired and unimpaired CVAD sites. RESULTS: Clinicians (n = 1044) residing in 34 countries reported diversity in their practice, with the majority of respondents practicing as nurses (89%) from North America (81%) as vascular access specialists (52%). The respondents' reported practice was variant, with differing inconsistency to guidelines throughout each of the domains. There was wide variance in the management of CVAD sites with impaired skin integrity, such as rash, skin stripping/adhesive-related injuries and drainage. Vascular access clinicians reported high levels of confidence in managing CVAD sites, including those with impaired skin. CONCLUSIONS: These inconsistencies are reflective of the complex and heterogeneous populations requiring CVADs, the evidence available to support practice in this area, the skills and knowledge of the clinicians caring for them and the resources of the healthcare setting. Further research and education is necessary to ensure that CVAD site care is undertaken effectively to minimise preventable complications.

31808719,2021,Influence of arm position change from adduction to abduction on intracavitary electrocardiogram. ,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of arm movements from adduction to abduction on intracavitary electrocardiogram and the position of a catheter tip. METHODS: Overall, 192 peripherally inserted central catheter lines were placed under intracavitary electrocardiogram guidance and 188 of them were enrolled in the study. The catheter was first placed at a time point corresponding to the peak P wave with the arm in adduction. The arm was then abducted to 90° without changing catheter insertion length. During the procedure, basal electrocardiogram, intracavitary electrocardiogram, and radiographs with the arm in adduction and abduction were recorded. Amplitude wave changes and catheter movements were measured on electrocardiogram records and radiographs, respectively. RESULTS: In 188 cases, the P wave displayed typical changes, and 97.8% (184/188) catheters were successfully placed correctly. At the peak P wave, the amplitude of the peak P wave was 8.64 times greater than that of the basal P wave, and the P/R ratio was 0.61. When the arm was abducted to 90°, the amplitude of the P wave dropped to 57% of its peak, P/R decreased from 0.61 to 0.34, and the catheter tip moved cephalad 1.00 and 0.77 vertebral body units in male and female patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: Peripherally inserted central catheter moves toward the heart when the arm position changes from abduction to adduction. Peripherally inserted central catheter tip placement at the peak P wave with patient's arm in adduction is accurate and can prevent the catheter from advancing too low. R wave can function as a reference for observing P wave changes during peripherally inserted central catheter placement.

28353488,2017,Management of Central Venous Access Device-Associated Skin Impairment: An Evidence-Based Algorithm. ,"Patients relying on central venous access devices (CVADs) for treatment are frequently complex. Many have multiple comorbid conditions, including renal impairment, nutritional deficiencies, hematologic disorders, or cancer. These conditions can impair the skin surrounding the CVAD insertion site, resulting in an increased likelihood of skin damage when standard CVAD management practices are employed. Supported by the World Congress of Vascular Access (WoCoVA), developed an evidence- and consensus-based algorithm to improve CVAD-associated skin impairment (CASI) identification and diagnosis, guide clinical decision-making, and improve clinician confidence in managing CASI. A scoping review of relevant literature surrounding CASI management was undertaken March 2014, and results were distributed to an international advisory panel. A CASI algorithm was developed by an international advisory panel of clinicians with expertise in wounds, vascular access, pediatrics, geriatric care, home care, intensive care, infection control and acute care, using a 2-phase, modified Delphi technique. The algorithm focuses on identification and treatment of skin injury, exit site infection, noninfectious exudate, and skin irritation/contact dermatitis. It comprised 3 domains: assessment, skin protection, and patient comfort. External validation of the algorithm was achieved by prospective pre- and posttest design, using clinical scenarios and self-reported clinician confidence (Likert scale), and incorporating algorithm feasibility and face validity endpoints. The CASI algorithm was found to significantly increase participants' confidence in the assessment and management of skin injury (P = .002), skin irritation/contact dermatitis (P = .001), and noninfectious exudate (P < .01). A majority of participants reported the algorithm as easy to understand (24/25; 96%), containing all necessary information (24/25; 96%). Twenty-four of 25 (96%) stated that they would recommend the tool to guide management of CASI.

30596472,2019,Insertion of peripherally inserted central catheters with intracavitary electrocardiogram guidance: A randomized multicenter study in China. ,"INTRODUCTION: Ultrasound-guided venipuncture and tip location by intracavitary electrocardiogram have many advantages during the insertion of peripherally inserted central catheters, both in terms of safety and cost-effectiveness. Recently, a new tip-conductive peripherally inserted central catheters and new Doppler ultrasound device integrated with intracavitary electrocardiogram have been introduced into clinical practice in China. A randomized multicenter study (clinical trial no. NCT03230357) was performed to verify the feasibility and accuracy of intracavitary electrocardiogram, as performed with this new peripherally inserted central catheters and device. METHODS: Our study enrolled a total of 2250 adult patients in 10 different Chinese hospitals. The patients were randomly assigned to either the study group (intracavitary electrocardiogram) or the control group (anatomical landmark guidance) in a 2:1 allocation. Ultrasound was used in both groups for venipuncture and tip navigation. All patients underwent chest X-ray after the procedure to verify the position of the catheter tip. RESULTS: No insertion-related complications were reported in either group. In the study group, first-attempt successful tip location was 91.7% (95% confidence interval: 90.3%-93.1%), significantly higher than 78.9% (95% confidence interval: 76.0%-81.9%) observed in the control group (p < 0.001). As evaluated by post-procedural chest X-ray, tip location in the study group had a sensitivity of 99.3% (95% confidence interval: 98.8%-99.7%), significantly higher than 86.8% (95% confidence interval: 84.4%-89.2%) observed in the anatomical landmark group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: These results indicated that during peripherally inserted central catheters insertion in adult patients, tip location with intracavitary electrocardiogram guidance, as carried out by a new tip-conductive peripherally inserted central catheters and intracavitary electrocardiogram integrated ultrasound device, was more effective and more accurate than tip location using anatomical landmarks.

35272305,2022,Influence of Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters With Proximal Valves on Red Blood Cell Hemolysis During Transfusion. ,"The aim of this study was to verify the occurrence of hemolysis after infusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) in 12 peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) with a proximal valve, according to size and infusion rate. This was an experimental in vitro study performed under laboratory-controlled conditions, and the sample was composed of 12 PICCs with proximal valves (3F and 4F catheter). Twelve type A+ aliquots from 10 PRBCs were analyzed preinfusion and postinfusion according to PICC size and infusion rate. Hemolysis markers, total hemoglobin (g/dL), hematocrit (%), free hemoglobin (g/dL), potassium (mmol/L), lactate dehydrogenase (U/L), and rate of hemolysis (%) were studied. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and Bonferroni multiple comparison tests. After the infusions in 3F PICCs, an increase was seen in rate of hemolysis (P = .003) and free hemoglobin (P = .014), in addition to a reduction in total hemoglobin (P = .002), with significant influence of minimum and maximum flow rates on the rate of hemolysis. The study finding indicated that the smaller catheter size and the infusion rate influenced variations in some hemolysis markers, but the alterations observed in the hemolysis markers would not contraindicate the infusion of PRBCs by 3F and 4F PICCs with proximal valves.

32551112,2020,Risk factors for peripherally inserted central catheter line-related deep venous thrombosis in critically ill intensive care unit patients. ,"INTRODUCTION: Central venous access using peripherally inserted central catheters is frequently used for patients receiving intravenous medications in the hospital or outpatients. Although there are several benefits of peripherally inserted central catheters, such as ease of insertion, low procedure-related risk and higher patient satisfaction, there are complications associated with peripherally inserted central catheter use. Despite some studies evaluating peripherally inserted central catheter line-related complications, the factors associated with peripherally inserted central catheter-related deep venous thrombosis in critically ill medical-surgical patients are poorly described. The objective of this case-control study was to identify the risk factors associated with peripherally inserted central catheter line-related deep venous thrombosis in critically ill medical-surgical intensive care unit patients in a community hospital. METHODS: We abstracted relevant clinical data from 21 cases with symptomatic peripherally inserted central catheter-related deep venous thrombosis and 42 controls with peripherally inserted central catheters but no deep venous thrombosis. RESULTS: Of the factors evaluated, female gender, the use of triple lumen peripherally inserted central catheters, larger outer diameter, and open (vs valve) peripherally inserted central catheters were associated with venous thrombosis. In this retrospective study, we did not identify any association of peripherally inserted central catheter-related deep venous thrombosis with a prior history of deep venous thrombosis, use of alteplase, antiplatelet therapy, prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation, international normalized ratio, platelet count and the use of peripherally inserted central catheters for total parenteral nutrition. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that the catheter size relative to the diameter of the vein could be an important risk factor for the development of peripherally inserted central catheter-related deep venous thrombosis. The study findings should be confirmed in a larger study designed to identify risk factors of peripherally inserted central catheter-related deep venous thrombosis. In the meantime, the peripherally inserted central catheter lines should be used judiciously in critically ill patients.
