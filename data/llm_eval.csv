26045668,Seasonality (summer / warm),Yes,"the incidence and risk factors of peripherally inserted central catheter-related infection among cancer patients. . background: as the use of peripherally inserted central catheters (piccs) increased in chemotherapy, the identification of complications and risk factors became essential to prevent patient harm. but little is known about picc-related infection and risk factors among patients with cancer. our study was to identify the prevalence, patterns, and risk factors of catheter-related infections associated with piccs. methods: a 3-year prospective cohort study was conducted in a university-affiliated hospital. all patients with cancer who met inclusion criteria were enrolled. the patients were followed up until catheter removal. tip cultures were routinely performed at the time of catheter removal. the general information was recorded at the time of picc insertion, weekly care, and removal. univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied for identification of risk factors. results: in total, 912 cancer patients with 912 piccs of 96,307 catheter days were enrolled. ninety-four developed picc-related infection; 46 were exit-site infection, 43 were catheter bacterial colonization, and five were picc-related bloodstream infection. the median time from catheter insertion to infection was 98.26 days. multivariate analysis showed statlock fixing (odds ratio [or] =0.555, 95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.326-0.945) and tip position located in the lower one-third of the superior vena cava (or =0.340, 95% ci: 0.202-0.571) were associated with lower picc infection rate. catheter care delay (or =2.612, 95% ci: 1.373-4.969) and indwelling mostly in summer (or =4.784, 95% ci: 2.681-8.538) were associated with higher infection incidence. conclusion: statlock fixing and tip position located in the lower one-third of the superior vena cava were protective factors against picc-related infection, while catheter care delay and indwelling mostly in summer were risk factors. policy and measures targeting these factors may be necessary to reduce the risk of infection. "
28651885,Antibiotic therapy,Yes,"use of antibiotic beads to salvage infected breast implants. . purpose: when an implant becomes infected, implant salvage is often performed where the implant is removed, capsulectomy is performed, and a new implant is inserted. the patient is discharged with a picc line and 6-8 weeks of intravenous (iv) antibiotics. this method has variable success and subjects the patient to long-term systemic antibiotics. in the 1960s, the use of antibiotic-impregnated beads for the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis was described. these beads deliver antibiotic directly to the site of the infection, thereby eliminating the complications of systemic iv antibiotics. this study aimed to present a case series illustrating the use of stimulan calcium sulfate beads loaded with vancomycin and tobramycin to increase the rate of salvage of the infected implant and forgo iv antibiotics. methods: a retrospective analysis was performed of patients who were treated at mount sinai hospital for implant infection with salvage and antibiotic beads. results: twelve patients were identified, 10 of whom had breast cancer. comorbidities included hypertension, smoking, and immunocompromised status. infections were noted anywhere from 5 days to 8 years postoperatively. salvage was successful in 9 out of the 12 infected implants using antibiotic bead therapy without home iv antibiotics. conclusions: the use of antibiotic beads is promising for salvaging infected breast implants without iv antibiotics. seventy-five percent of the implants were successfully salvaged. of the three patients who had unsalvageable implants, one was infected with antibiotic-resistant rhodococcus that was refractory to bead therapy and one was noncompliant with postoperative instructions.
