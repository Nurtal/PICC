34600737,Gender,No,"picc versus midlines: comparison of peripherally inserted central catheters and midline catheters with respect to incidence of thromboembolic and infectious complications. . introduction: to decrease the complications related to central catheters there has been an increasing utilization of peripherally inserted central catheters (picc) and ultrasound-guided long peripheral intravenous catheters (i.e. midlines). while the complications of picc lines are well described there is less reported data on complications related to midline catheters. our study aims are to compare the incidences of infectious and deep venous thrombosis (dvt) and sepsis related to piccs and midlines. methods: we performed a single-center retrospective review at an academic hospital. data were collected on patients admitted between 1/1/2014-5/31/2016. patient demographics, hospital length of stay (los), and ventilator days were collected. outcomes of interest were line-related infections and thromboembolic events after the placement of these catheters. endpoints were compared between three groups (picc group, midline group and picc placement followed by midline placement group). univariate and multivariable analyses were used to compare across the three groups. results: the study included 3560 unique patients with 5058 catheters. there was an increase in use of midlines over the observed study period (245% increase from the end of 2015 to the middle of 2016). we found no significant differences in the rates of dvt among the three groups (picc 4%, midline 3% and picc-midline 4%; p = 0.12). there were no differences across the groups for sepsis (picc 29%, midline 27%, and picc-midline 32%; p = 0.14) or septic shock (picc 7%, midline 8%, and picc-midline 6%; p = 0.39). adjusted means los were higher for patients with picc lines compared to midlines, in both females and males. picc group stayed longer, on average, on the ventilator compared to the midline group. no other significant differences were seen among groups. conclusion: increased utilization of midline catheters were not associated with decreased risk of dvt or sepsis when compared to peripherally inserted central catheters.

36726149,Cancer,Yes,"efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban for the treatment of picc-related upper extremity deep vein thrombosis in cancer patients: a retrospective study. . background: the optimal duration and choice of anticoagulant for the treatment of peripherally inserted central catheters (picc)-related upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (uedvt) in cancer patients are still undetermined. objectives: the aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban for the treatment of picc-related uedvt in cancer patients. methods: we conducted a retrospective cohort study including consecutive cancer patients for the management of acute symptomatic picc-related uedvt. the efficacy outcome of the study was the 180-day recurrence of any venous thromboembolism (vte), while the safety outcome was the 180-day incidence of all bleeding events. the kaplan‒meier method was used to estimate the overall incidence. hazard ratios (hrs) were obtained with a cox proportional hazards model to estimate the risk of the outcome events. results: a total of 217 patients were included in the final analysis with a median age of 56 years old, 41.5% of whom had metastases. after the initial 3-5 days of nadroparin, patients received sequential anticoagulation, either with nadroparin (118 patients) or with rivaroxaban (99 patients). four patients with recurrent vte were observed (nadroparin, n = 2; rivaroxaban, n = 2). the 180-day cumulative vte recurrence rates were 1.7% and 2.0% (p = 0.777) in patients receiving nadroparin and rivaroxaban, respectively. the overall bleeding rate at 180 days was 8.8%. although no major bleeding events were observed, nineteen patients with clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (crnmb) were observed. the 180-day cumulative rate of crnmb was 5.1% for nadroparin and 13.1% for rivaroxaban (hr = 3.303, 95% ci 1.149-9.497, p = 0.027). conclusion: our study supported the efficacy of rivaroxaban for treating picc-related uedvt in cancer patients. however, data on anticoagulation therapy for picc-related uedvt presented with a low risk of vte recurrence and a relatively high risk of crnmb bleeding events. considering the risk-benefit ratio, further well-designed trials are required to optimize the drug selection and duration for the treatment of picc-related uedvt in cancer patients.

36676072,PICC infection,Yes,"infectious risks related to umbilical venous catheter dwell time and its replacement in newborns: a narrative review of current evidence. . the use of umbilical venous catheters (uvcs) has become the standard of care in the neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) to administer fluids, medications and parenteral nutrition. however, it is well known that uvcs can lead to some serious complications, both mechanical and infective, including clabsi (central line-associated bloodstream infections). most authors recommend removing uvc within a maximum of 14 days from its placement. however, the last infusion therapy standards of practice (ins) guidelines recommends limiting the uvc dwell time to 7 to 10 days, to reduce risks of infectious and thrombotic complications. these guidelines also suggest as an infection prevention strategy to remove uvc after 4 days, followed by the insertion of a picc if a central line is still needed. nevertheless, the maximum uvc dwell time to reduce the risk of clabsi is still controversial, as well as the time of its replacement with a picc. in this study we reviewed a total of 177 articles, found by using the pubmed database with the following search strings: ""uvc and neonates"", ""(neonate* or newborn*) and (uvc or central catheter*) and (infection*)"". we also analyze the ins guidelines to provide the reader an updated overview on this topic. the purpose of this review is to give updated information on cvcs infectious risks by examining the literature in this field. these data could help clinicians in deciding the best time to remove or to replace the uvc with a picc, to reduce clabsis risk. despite the lack of strong evidence, the risk of clabsi seems to be minimized when uvc is removed/replaced within 7 days from insertion and this indication is emerging from more recent and larger studies.

27957644,PICC insertion procedure,Yes,"tip malposition of peripherally inserted central catheters: a prospective randomized controlled trial to compare bedside insertion to fluoroscopically guided placement. . objective: peripherally inserted central catheter (picc) use continues to increase, leading to the development of a blind bedside technique (bst) for placement. the aim of our study was to compare the bst with the fluoroscopically guided technique (fgt), with specific regard to catheter tip position (ctp). materials and methods: one hundred eighty patients were randomized to either the bst or the fgt. all procedures were done by the same interventional team and included postprocedural chest x-ray to assess ctp. depending on the international guidelines for optimal ctp, patients were classified in three types: optimal, suboptimal not needing repositioning, and nonoptimal requiring additional repositioning procedures. fisher's test was used for comparisons. results: one hundred seventy-one piccs were successful inserted. in the bst groups, 23.3% of placements were suboptimal and 30% nonoptimal, requiring repositioning. in the fgt group, 5.6% were suboptimal and 1.1% nonoptimal. thus, suboptimal and nonoptimal ctp were significantly lower in the fgt group (p < 0.001). conclusion: tip malposition rates are high when using blind bst, exposing the patient to an increased risk of deep venous thrombosis and catheter malfunction. using the fgt or emerging technologies that could help tip positioning are recommended, especially for long-term indications. key points: • bedside and fluoroscopy guided techniques are commonly used for picc placement. • catheter malposition is the major technical issue with the bedside technique. • catheter malposition occurred in 53% of patients with the bedside technique.

37166852,Gender,Yes,"the association of vasopressor administration through a midline catheter with catheter-related complications. . rationale: little is known about the safety of infusing vasopressors through a midline catheter. objectives: to evaluate safety outcomes after vasopressor administration through a midline. methods: we conducted a cohort study of adults admitted to 39 hospitals in michigan (december 2017-march 2022) who received vasopressors while either a midline or peripherally inserted central catheter (picc) was in place. patients receiving vasopressors through a midline were compared with those receiving vasopressors through a picc and, separately, to those with midlines in place but who received vasopressors through a different catheter. we used descriptive statistics to characterize and compare cohort characteristics. multivariable mixed effects logistic regression models were fit to determine the association between vasopressor administration through a midline with outcomes, primarily catheter-related complications (bloodstream infection, superficial thrombophlebitis, exit site infection, or catheter occlusion). results: our cohort included 287 patients with midlines through which vasopressors were administered, 1,660 with piccs through which vasopressors were administered, and 884 patients with midlines who received vasopressors through a separate catheter. age (median [interquartile range]: 68.7 [58.6-75.7], 66.6 [57.1-75.0], and 67.6 [58.7-75.8] yr) and gender (percentage female: 50.5%, 47.3%, and 43.8%) were similar in all groups. the frequency of catheter-related complications was lower in patients with midlines used for vasopressors than piccs used for vasopressors (5.2% vs. 13.4%; p < 0.001) but similar to midlines with vasopressor administration through a different device (5.2% vs. 6.3%; p = 0.49). after adjustment, administration of vasopressors through a midline was not associated with catheter-related complications compared with piccs with vasopressors (adjusted odds ratios [aor], 0.65 [95% confidence interval, 0.31-1.33]; p = 0.23) or midlines with vasopressors elsewhere (aor, 0.85 [0.46-1.58]; p = 0.59). midlines used for vasopressors were associated with greater risk of systemic thromboembolism (vs. piccs with vasopressors: aor, 2.69 [1.31-5.49]; p = 0.008; vs. midlines with vasopressors elsewhere: aor, 2.42 [1.29-4.54]; p = 0.008) but not thromboses restricted to the ipsilateral upper extremity (vs. piccs with vasopressors: aor, 2.35 [0.83-6.63]; p = 0.10; model did not converge for vs. midlines with vasopressors elsewhere). conclusions: we found no significant association of vasopressor administration through a midline with catheter-related complications. however, we identified increased odds of systemic (but not ipsilateral upper extremity) venous thromboembolism warranting further evaluation.

29293304,PICC infection,Yes,". central venous access devices (cvads) or central venous catheters (cvcs) are devices that are inserted into the body through a vein to enable the administration of fluids, blood products, medication and other therapies to the bloodstream. cvads can be inserted into the subclavian or jugular vein (implanted ports, tunneled catheters), or can be inserted into one of the peripheral veins of the upper extremities, called peripherally inserted central catheters (piccs). while generally safe, cvads can be associated with complications such as catheter occlusion or rupture, venous thrombosis, and bloodstream infection. a number of strategies have been used to minimize the occurrence of cvad- and picc-associated complications such as antimicrobial-impregnated lines for prevention of infection, or addition of a valve (valved catheters) to prevent occlusion by preventing reflux of blood into the catheter. flushing the catheters with saline or heparin – an agent with anticoagulant activity - have been used to reduce clot formation and occlusion of the catheters. this rapid response report is an update of the previous cadth reports which found no difference in terms of frequency of occlusion in patients who had a valved versus a non-valved piccs, and similar patency between heparin and saline use for cvcs.(,) this report aims to review the evidence on the clinical effectiveness of valved versus non-valved piccs, and saline versus heparin flushing in the maintenance of cvads patency and reduction of complications.
